%
A System is a set of variables sufficiently isolated to stay constant long enough for us to discuss it.
%
Division of the world's system into Natural and Man-made died with Darwin.
%

By the time sexual reproduction has been achieved, the main difficulty of evolution is past.
%
The brain is merely Nature's latest means of self-preservation.
%
The goals of a species, such as Homo, are what natural selection has driven it to.
%
The species is fundamentally aimless (it finds its goals as it goes along).
%
The goals in evolution are what a species has been forced to.
%
Poor M. Jourdain! He now has to understand that he has been behaving homeostatically all his life, when he thought he was merely minding his business.
%
For two thousand years psychology was a simple description of Man's highest faculties--most of which he does not posses.
%
The scientist does not believe in effects without causes, not even when they happen in the brain.
%
That homo has a brain, no more entitles him to assume he knows how he thinks than possession of a liver entitles him to assume that he knows how he metabolises.
%
A man no more knows how he thinks, just because he has a brain in his skull, than he knows how he makes blood, because he has marrow in his bones.
%
The brain is natures latest and ferocious instrument of self preservation.
%
Remember: The brain has no brain inside to guide it.
%
To think is to act--inside the brain.
%
The brain controls nothing--it transmits.
%
The brain organizes nothing--it acts.

The brain has no gimmick, just five billion years [≈ the approximate age of the Solar system and the Sun] of research and development.
%
The brain knows nothing of how it ought to act it knows only what it does.
%
The test of a brain is its achievement of a goal.

No system is brain like - every system is brain like - as you please.
%
Natural selection insists that neuronic details shall be irrelevant for whole behavior.
%
Natural selection insists that the nature of the parts shall be irrelevant for the behavior.
%
The neurone is the one unit that, in psychology, is quite devoid of interest, it is too small to be visible in the man's action, and too large to be sufficient in memory.
%
The neurone is the one unit that, in behaviour, is quite devoid of interest today it is too small to be noticeable in a man's action, and too gross to carry a trace of memory.
%
No mammal will ever understand the mammalian brain completely.
%
The man who talks today of probability in the brain is usually trying to return to the days when everything in the brain was so delightfully vague.
%
No man knows what to do against the really new.

%
Don't appoint, as the President's driver, an Englishman who has spent thirty years learning to drive on the left.
%
A system that stores its memories away from their site of action must do much work remembering where it put that memory.
%
There is no memory in the present - only a state of affairs
%
A mechanism is "brain-like" so far as it is effective: there is nothing more.
%
The only people who talk today of "real" intelligence are those who hope to find a meaning for the adjective later.
%
Intelligent is as intelligent does.
%
The drive to equilibrium horses the emergence of intelligence.
%
That the brain matches its environment is no more surprising than the matching of the two ends of a broken stick.

Change the environment to its opposite and every piece of wisdom becomes the Vaguely Unpleasant of folly.
%
For every bump of the phrenologist there exists an environment that demands a depression.
%
Everyone is World Champion at some game (although some of the games have not yet been recognized).
%
An Intelligence Test measures the degree to which Tester and Subject think alike.

Man adapts by conquering the reducible, the irreducible is impregnable.
%
We have broken into the Aladdin's cave of brain-like mechanisms; we find we can have anything we like--provided we pay for it!

From every faculty there is an environment that pessimises it.
%
We cannot read the book of God, only the observer's digest.

The computer can do more than the trained brain.
%
The rule for decision is: Use what you know to narrow the field as far as possible: after that, do as you please.
%
Any system that achieves appropriate selection (to a degree better than chance) does so as a consequence of information received.
%
To recognise a class is to throw away information
%
Some say that a first requirement is that it shall weigh 45 ounces.
%
No system adapts to the changing: it can adapt only to what is constant.
%
To speak of human behaviour, and then to speak of the neuron, is to show that one has not yet developed a sense of proportion.
%
Only the environment can design a brain.
%
Man's brain contains no blue print for brains against non-human environments.
%
The secret of the mammalian brain is that it has long and slavishly fashioned itself to its environment.
%
To refer to the head-ganglion of Homo sapiens as "Man's brain" is to appeal to our lowest prejudices

As every machine goes to equilibrium, it selects.
%
Functionally, the behaviour is the brain.
%
"Help one another" is the selfishness of the species.
%
"Logic" and "logical" are so degraded today that they convey no useful information. They are still used chiefly because they look well, either by the **** or by the unthinking
%
Every dynamic system has its preferred modes of vibration, perhaps simple, perhaps complex.
%
Rhapsodise as you will, a law of nature is just a constant.
%
Instincts of Homo
%
This species is peculiar in that members make an ever-increasing habit of attacking and exterminating weaker groups of their own species.
%
For ninety nine hundredths of this time (before any traces of town dwelling) he improved chiefly in his efficiency in killing big game and other branches of his own species.
%
The specially human part of the brain has been evolved for the chase and for tribal warfare. The final evolution allowed armies of continental size to massacre on a continental scale.

A concept is that which survives, is stable under a sequence of operations
%
The brain takes information from where it is useless and moves it to where it is useful.

%
The machine that can produce all trajectories has no laws.
%
The product set has no constraints.
%
Life-processes (in species or brains) use only the additive methods - for the combinatorial there has not been time enough.

In this universe, the life-time of a planet is only sufficient to allow its evolved life-form to explore the possibilities of additive adaptation.
%
All our adaptations are collections of nearly independent bits life is too short to alow us to explore the really holistic.

%
When we take the ordinates of a wave function and use them to compute their exact values a moment later, we are 
%
(1) demonstrating that the science of quantum physics use determinate systems.
%
(2) treats the system as determinate.
%
Every operation seeks the state that makes it impotent.
%
A "machine" is a shadow of simple succession.
%
"The time it takes increases exponentially" is a mathematical way of saying it can't be done.
%
If my sympathy with another's sufferings proves the reality of the other's feelings then the pattern of light and shade that I call a "weeping heroine" on the cinema screen is genuinely feeling.
