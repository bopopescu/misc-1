When does measurement error matter? If you can’t write “X correlates with Y” as “X correlates with scribbled survey asking about Y” without qualm.
%
The use of confidence intervals rather than p-values is a clear improvement; it makes our difficulties vanish like smoke in a fog.
%
p-value testing is weird, but with multiple correction, it gets even weirder: the more you measure & model, the less you know.
%
Power vs error vs sample size: painful tradeoff of statistics. Sins of omission, commission, & risk aversion—painful tradeoff of life?
%
Not doing power analysis with informative priors is searching a haystack of unknown size for a needle which probably isn’t there.
%
Power analysis: if there is enough light to find the needles in the haystack; variance component analysis: if there are any needles at all.
%
Heritability is like tossing a haystack into a furnace & fractioning the slag: you know the ratio of haystack:needle; but not where the needles were, how big the haystack was, whether many small needles painted yellow or a few big spears, how sharp the needles were, or your neighbor’s percentages.

When I was a little kid, I thought cars told their drivers where to go (using their turn signals). It took a while, but eventually, I was right.
%
Why do humans have such large costly brains? Cats and chimps can see or walk as well as us.—Because the decisions we make least with little feedback or rewards based on big data over a lifetime can matter the most. We may be at our most human while filling out the paperwork for life insurance. (With deep learning, the new Moravec’s paradox is not that AI finds hardest what we find the easiest, but that AI needs to be smallest—NN parameter count—what we need to be biggest!)
%
The news offers a fixed selection of the most extreme outlier (or should that be ‘outliar’?) datapoints, but the global population becomes larger every day. Thus my corollary to Littlewood’s law:
%
“Human extremes are not only weirder than we suppose, they are weirder than we can suppose.”

Science increasingly requires precise predictions which can fail, a willingness to fail, and sharing of the data demonstrating failure. Like honesty & simplicity, these are prices the most prestigious, wealthiest, and powerful find most difficult to pay.

Disappointments: when 23, reading a paper, realizing: “this is Peak Human. You may not like it, but this is it”. I had grown up: now differences were quantitative, not qualitative. (Never again would I see leaps like object permanence, theory of mind, numbers/counting, reading, the future, death, sarcasm, logic, game theory, programming, statistics… All it took to reach the human frontier was a mere 20 years.)
%
it is easier to invent a buggy “reliable” system than it is to understand a bugfree reliable system.
Corollary: no one understands a working complex system.

the complexity you add to a complex system to prevent failure is itself a major source of failure.

Like in security, the worst possible state for a power cord, USB cable, or database is half working.

Proving properties about systems reveals bugs; it doesn’t matter what property you prove! Similarly, a little fuzz testing goes a long way: your system is probably not robust even to a cat walking across a keyboard.
