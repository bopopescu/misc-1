LA NUE ET LA MORT
THE SEVEN EYES OF THE BLACK CAT
DEATH RINGS TWICE ON A SUMMER EVENING
DEATH SMILES ON A REPTILE WOMAN
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO OUR DOGS
SHORT NIGHT OF THE LONG GLASS MOON
SEVEN DOLLS IN A LIZARD'S EYE
THE BLACK BIRD WITH THE SILVER RING
THREE CRIMSON TAILS ON A GREY FOX
PHOTOGRAPHS OF A FORBIDDEN VICE
NINE STEPS DOWN A STRANGE CORRIDOR
STRANGE PHOTOGRAPHS OF AN UNKNOWN PERPETRATOR
DESPERATION
THE TASTE OF THE BLOODY KNIFE, THE SMELL OF THE BLOODY TEARS
DEATH VISITS A LADY
THREE FULL MOONS IN AN AUGUST SKY
CRY OUT FOR YOUR LOVER'S BLADE
SIX STRANGE KNIVES IN A DARK ROOM
THE TEARING OF THE FLESH, THE GRINDING OF THE GEARS
THE HANGING KNIFE STRIKES SIX TIMES
