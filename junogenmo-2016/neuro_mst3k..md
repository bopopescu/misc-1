PART ONE
CHIBA CITY BLUES


1

The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned
to a dead channel.
`It's not like I'm using,' Case heard someone say, as he
shouldered his way through the crowd around the door of the
Chat.  `It's like my body's developed this massive drug defi-
ciency.'  It was a Sprawl voice and a Sprawl joke.  The Chatsubo
was a bar for professional expatriates; you could drink there
for a week and never hear two words in Japanese.

Mike: Are we not blokes?

Ratz was tending bar, his prosthetic arm jerking monoto-
nously as he filled a tray of glasses with draft Kirin.  He saw

Mike: These are all just random sentences, folks.

Case and smiled, his teeth a webwork of East European steel
and brown decay.  Case found a place at the bar, between the
unlikely tan on one of Lonny Zone's whores and the crisp naval

uniform of a tall African whose cheekbones were ridged with
precise rows of tribal scars.  `Wage was in here early, with two
joeboys,' Ratz said, shoving a draft across the bar with his
good hand.  `Maybe some business with you, Case?'
Case shrugged.  The girl to his right giggled and nudged
him.
The bartender's smile widened.  His ugliness was the stuff

Narrator: Yes, this is the answer: a real selling wizard. 

of legend.  In an age of affordable beauty, there was something
heraldic about his lack of it.  The antique arm whined as he
reached for another mug.  It was a Russian military prosthesis,
a seven-function force-feedback manipulator, cased in grubby
pink plastic.  `You are too much the artiste, Herr Case.'  Ratz
grunted; the sound served him as laughter.  He scratched his
overhang of white-shirted belly with the pink claw.  `You are
the artiste of the slightly funny deal.'
`Sure,' Case said, and sipped his beer.  `Somebody's gotta

Joel: He gets his haircut on Tuesdays!

The whore's giggle went up an octave.
`Isn't you either, sister.  So you vanish, okay?  Zone, he's

She looked Case in the eye and made the softest possible

spitting sound, her lips barely moving.  But she left.
`Jesus,' Case said, `what kinda creepjoint you running here?

Crow: Let's see. What rhymes with "blue balls"?

Man can't have a drink.'
`Ha,' Ratz said, swabbing the scarred wood with a rag,
`Zone shows a percentage.  You I let work here for entertain-
ment value.'
As Case was picking up his beer, one of those strange
instants of silence descended, as though a hundred unrelated

conversations had simultaneously arrived at the same pause.
Then the whore's giggle rang out, tinged with a certain hysteria.
Ratz grunted.  `An angel passed.'
`The Chinese,' bellowed a drunken Australian, `Chinese

`Now that,' Case said to his glass, all his bitterness suddenly
rising in him like bile, `that is _so_ much bullshit.'

Crow: Tha— That's just a picture of the moon!


The Japanese had already forgotten more neurosurgery than
the Chinese had ever known.  The black clinics of Chiba were
the cutting edge, whole bodies of technique supplanted monthly,
and still they couldn't repair the damage he'd suffered in that
Memphis hotel.
A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading
nightly.  All the speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the
corners he'd cut in Night City, and still he'd see the matrix in
his sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless

boy.  Just another hustler, trying to make it through.  But the
dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo,
and he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the
dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands

clawed into the bedslab, temperfoam bunched between his fin-
gers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.

`I saw your girl last night,' Ratz said, passing Case his
second Kirin.
`I don't have one,' he said, and drank.

Servo: (imitates repeated burping)

`Miss Linda Lee.'
Case shook his head.
`No girl?  Nothing?  Only biz, friend artiste?  Dedication to
commerce?'  The bartender's small brown eyes were nested
deep in wrinkled flesh.  `I think I liked you better, with her.

Servo: I'm back!

You laughed more.  Now, some night, you get maybe too ar-
tistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.'
`You're breaking my heart, Ratz.'  He finished his beer,
paid and left, high narrow shoulders hunched beneath the rain-
stained khaki nylon of his windbreaker.  Threading his way
through the Ninsei crowds, he could smell his own stale sweat.

Crow: This is like NFL graphics here.


Case was twenty-four.  At twenty-two, he'd been a cowboy,
a rustler, one of the best in the Sprawl.  He'd been trained by
the best, by McCoy Pauley and Bobby Quine, legends in the
biz.  He'd operated on an almost permanent adrenaline high, a
byproduct of youth and proficiency, jacked into a custom cy-
berspace deck that projected his disembodied consciousness

Servo: 'Cuz this is where the fish lives.

into the consensual hallucination that was the matrix.  A thief,
he'd worked for other, wealthier thieves, employers who pro-
vided the exotic software required to penetrate the bright walls
of corporate systems, opening windows into rich fields of data.
He'd made the classic mistake, the one he'd sworn he'd
never make.  He stole from his employers.  He kept something
for himself and tried to move it through a fence in Amsterdam.

Mike: I understand everything up to the word "A".

He still wasn't sure how he'd been discovered, not that it
mattered now.  He'd expected to die, then, but they only smiled.

Mike: Well... now I can't get back to sleep, either. What do you wanna do? 

Of course he was welcome, they told him, welcome to the
money.  And he was going to need it.  Because -- still smiling --
they were going to make sure he never worked again.
They damaged his nervous system with a wartime Russian
mycotoxin.

The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective.

His total assets were quickly converted to New Yen, a fat
sheaf of the old paper currency that circulated endlessly through
the closed circuit of the world's black markets like the seashells
of the Trobriand islanders.  It was difficult to transact legitimate

business with cash in the Sprawl; in Japan, it was already
illegal.
In Japan, he'd known with a clenched and absolute certainty,
he'd find his cure.  In Chiba.  Either in a registered clinic or in
the shadowland of black medicine.  Synonymous with implants,
nerve-splicing, and microbionics, Chiba was a magnet for the
Sprawl's techno-criminal subcultures.

Narrator: A skilled workforce makes Puerto Rico the largest manufacturer of many computers, and a leader in solid-state technology. 

In Chiba, he'd watched his New Yen vanish in a two-month
round of examinations and consultations.  The men in the black
clinics, his last hope, had admired the expertise with which
he'd been maimed, and then slowly shaken their heads.
Now he slept in the cheapest coffins, the ones nearest the
port, beneath the quartz-halogen floods that lit the docks all
night like vast stages; where you couldn't see the lights of
Tokyo for the glare of the television sky, not even the towering
hologram logo of the Fuji Electric Company, and Tokyo Bay
was a black expanse where gulls wheeled above drifting shoals
of white styrofoam.  Behind the port lay the city, factory domes
dominated by the vast cubes of corporate arcologies.  Port and
city were divided by a narrow borderland of older streets, an

The Jarre was walled with mirrors, each panel framed in

At first, finding himself alone in Chiba, with little money

and less hope of finding a cure, he'd gone into a kind of terminal
overdrive, hustling fresh capital with a cold intensity that had
seemed to belong to someone else.  In the first month, he'd
killed two men and a woman over sums that a year before

would have seemed ludicrous.  Ninsei wore him down until the
street itself came to seem the externalization of some death

Biz here was a constant subliminal hum, and death the
accepted punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of grace,
the failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol.
Alone at a table in the Jarre de Th, with the octagon coming
on, pinheads of sweat starting from his palms, suddenly aware
of each tingling hair on his arms and chest, Case knew that at
some point he'd started to play a game with himself, a very

for being able to get whatever you wanted.  A part of him knew
that the arc of his self-destruction was glaringly obvious to his
customers, who grew steadily fewer, but that same part of him
basked in the knowledge that it was only a matter of time.  And
that was the part of him, smug in its expectation of death, that
most hated the thought of Linda Lee.
He'd found her, one rainy night, in an arcade.

the New York skyline...  And now he remembered her that
way, her face bathed in restless laser light, features reduced to
a code: her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard's Castle burned,
forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to the Tank
War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck
sparks from the wall of a skyscraper canyon.  He was riding
high that night, with a brick of Wage's ketamine on its way

in out of the warm rain that sizzled across the Ninsei pavement
and somehow she'd been singled out for him, one face out of
the dozens who stood at the consoles, lost in the game she
played.  The expression on her face, then, had been the one
he'd seen, hours later, on her sleeping face in a portside coffin,
her upper lip like the line children draw to represent a bird in
flight.

Servo: The Vampire Precision Flight Team in formation!

Crossing the arcade to stand beside her, high on the deal
he'd made, he saw her glance up.  Gray eyes rimmed with

smudged black paintstick.  Eyes of some animal pinned in the
headlights of an oncoming vehicle.
Their night together stretching into a morning, into tickets
at the hoverport and his first trip across the Bay.  The rain kept
up, falling along Harajuku, beading on her plastic jacket, the
children of Tokyo trooping past the famous boutiques in white

loafers and clingwrap capes, until she'd stood with him in the
midnight clatter of a pachinko parlor and held his hand like a
child.
It took a month for the gestalt of drugs and tension he moved
through to turn those perpetually startled eyes into wells of
reflexive need.  He'd watched her personality fragment, calving

like an iceberg, splinters drifting away, and finally he'd seen
the raw need, the hungry armature of addiction.  He'd watched
her track the next hit with a concentration that reminded him

of the mantises they sold in stalls along Shiga, beside tanks of
blue mutant carp and crickets caged in bamboo.

Crow: The act was outlawed on several continents!

He stared at the black ring of grounds in his empty cup.  It
was vibrating with the speed he'd taken.  The brown laminate
of the tabletop was dull with a patina of tiny scratches.  With
the dex mounting through his spine he saw the countless random
impacts required to create a surface like that.  The Jarre was
decorated in a dated, nameless style from the previous century,
an uneasy blend of Japanese traditional and pale Milanese plas-

tics, but everything seemed to wear a subtle film, as though
the bad nerves of a million customers had somehow attacked
the mirrors and the once glossy plastics, leaving each surface
fogged with something that could never be wiped away.
`Hey.  Case, good buddy...'

Crow Cutout: Look out, you little doodad!

He looked up, met gray eyes ringed with paintstick.  She
was wearing faded French orbital fatigues and new white sneak-
ers.

Mr. Gardner: I'll never understand what my son saw in you.

`I been lookin'~ for you, man.'  She took a seat opposite
him, her elbows on the table.  The sleeves of the blue zipsuit
had been ripped out at the shoulders; he automatically checked

her arms for signs of derms or the needle.  `Want a cigarette?'

Crow: The illegal smuggling of mimes. Nobody ever talks about it. 

She dug a crumpled pack of Yeheyuan filters from an ankle
pocket and offered him one.  He took it, let her light it with a
red plastic tube.  `You sleepin'~ okay, Case?  You look tired.'
Her accent put her south along the Sprawl, toward Atlanta.
The skin below her eyes was pale and unhealthy-looking, but

a band of printed silk.  The pattern might have represented
microcircuits, or a city map.
`Not if I remember to take my pills,' he said, as a tangible

wave of longing hit him, lust and loneliness riding in on the
wavelength of amphetamine.  He remembered the smell of her
skin in the overheated darkness of a coffin near the port, her
fingers locked across the small of his back.
All the meat, he thought, and all it wants.
`Wage,' she said, narrowing her eyes.  `He wants to see
you with a hole in your face.'  She lit her own cigarette.

Joe: ...or the dull tap-tap of tools on leather. CrowTap ta-tap-tap... I keep Popular Mechanics under my mattress!

`Who says?  Ratz?  You been talking to Ratz?'
`No.  Mona.  Her new squeeze is one of Wage's boys.'

Crow: The lawsuts begin.

`I don't owe him enough.  He does me, he's out the money
anyway.'  He shrugged.
`Too many people owe him now, Case.  Maybe you get to
be the example.  You seriously better watch it.'
`Sure.  How about you, Linda?  You got anywhere to sleep?'
`Sleep.'  She shook her head.  `Sure, Case.'  She shivered,

hunched forward over the table.  Her face was filmed with
sweat.
`Here,' he said, and dug in the pocket of his windbreaker,
coming up with a crumpled fifty.  He smoothed it automatically,
under the table, folded it in quarters, and passed it to her.
`You need that, honey.  You better give it to Wage.'  There
was something in the gray eyes now that he couldn't read,
something he'd never seen there before.

Joel: DO SOMETHING!!! God!

`I owe Wage a lot more than that.  Take it.  I got more
coming,' he lied, as he watched his New Yen vanish into a
zippered pocket.
`You get your money, Case, you find Wage quick.'
`I'll see you, Linda,' he said, getting up.
`Sure.'  A millimeter of white showed beneath each of her
pupils.  Sanpaku.  `You watch your back, man.'
He nodded, anxious to be gone.
He looked back as the plastic door swung shut behind him,
saw her eyes reflected in a cage of red neon.

by, spotting the Mitsubishi-Genentech logo tattooed across the
back of the man's right hand.

Joel: Iowa State College: The high school after high school!

Was it authentic?  If that's for real, he thought, he's in for
trouble.  If it wasn't, served him right.  M-G employees above
a certain level were implanted with advanced microprocessors
that monitored mutagen levels in the bloodstream.  Gear like
that would get you rolled in Night City, rolled straight into a
black clinic.

Ted Husing: It read: "Want immediately one live bobcat, two cub black bears, and three six-foot diamondback rattlers."

The sarariman had been Japanese, but the Ninsei crowd was
a gaijin crowd.  Groups of sailors up from the port, tense solitary
tourists hunting pleasures no guidebook listed, Sprawl heavies
showing off grafts and implants, and a dozen distinct species

Servo: Yes, it's dehumanized, objectified circus on ice! 

of hustler, all swarming the street in an intricate dance of desire
and commerce.

Crow: Hey, what a coincidence, there were two guys named Bill Rebane! Heh heh...y'know, ya see, 'cause of the thing with the... and the... uh, the guy, the...This is gonna suck. 

There were countless theories explaining why Chiba City
tolerated the Ninsei enclave, but Case tended toward the idea
that the Yakuza might be preserving the place as a kind of
historical park, a reminder of humble origins.  But he also
saw a certain sense in the notion that burgeoning technologies
require outlaw zones, that Night City wasn't there for its in-
habitants, but as a deliberately unsupervised playground for
technology itself.
Was Linda right, he wondered, staring up at the lights?
Would Wage have him killed to make an example?  It didn't
make much sense, but then Wage dealt primarily in proscribed

Crow: Alright, now we're in England.

biologicals, and they said you had to be crazy to do that.

Mike: I could have done that... 

But Linda said Wage wanted him dead.  Case's primary
insight into the dynamics of street dealing was that neither the
buyer nor the seller really needed him.  A middleman's business
is to make himself a necessary evil.  The dubious niche Case
had carved for himself in the criminal ecology of Night City
had been cut out with lies, scooped out a night at a time with
betrayal.  Now, sensing that its walls were starting to crumble,
he felt the edge of a strange euphoria.
The week before, he'd delayed transfer of a synthetic glan-
dular extract, retailing it for a wider margin than usual.  He
knew Wage hadn't liked that.  Wage was his primary supplier,
nine years in Chiba and one of the few gaijin dealers who'd
managed to forge links with the rigidly stratified criminal es-
tablishment beyond Night City's borders.  Genetic materials and
hormones trickled down to Ninsei along an intricate ladder of
fronts and blinds.  Somehow Wage had managed to trace some-
thing back, once, and now he enjoyed steady connections in a
dozen cities.
Case found himself staring through a shop window.  The

Mike: Free beer! 

place sold small bright objects to the sailors.  Watches, flic-
knives, lighters, pocket VTRs, simstim decks, weighted man-
riki chains, and shuriken.  The shuriken had always fascinated
him, steel stars with knife-sharp points.  Some were chromed,
others black, others treated with a rainbow surface like oil on
water.  But the chrome stars held his gaze.  They were mounted
against scarlet ultrasuede with nearly invisible loops of nylon
fishline, their centers stamped with dragons or yinyang sym-

of his DNA, a procedure unavailable in Chiba.  Then he'd fly
to Hongkong and order the year's suits and shirts.  Sexless and
inhumanly patient, his primary gratification seemed to lie in
his devotion to esoteric forms of tailor-worship.  Case had never
seen him wear the same suit twice, although his wardrobe

time.  The room was stacked with white fiberglass shipping
modules that gave off the tang of preserved ginger.

Crow: Little Richard: the one true talent in this film!

`You seem to be clean, old son,' said Deane's disembodied
voice.  `Do come in.'
Magnetic bolts thudded out of position around the massive
imitation-rosewood door to the left of the bookcases.  JULIUS
DEANE IMPORT EXPORT was lettered across the plastic in
peeling self-adhesive capitals.  If the furniture scattered in
Deane's makeshift foyer suggested the end of the past century,
the office itself seemed to belong to its start.
Deane's seamless pink face regarded Case from a pool of
light cast by an ancient brass lamp with a rectangular shade of
dark green glass.  The importer was securely fenced behind a
vast desk of painted steel, flanked on either side by tall, draw-
ered cabinets made of some sort of pale wood.  The sort of

scrolls of yellowed printout, and various parts of some sort of

clockwork typewriter, a machine Deane never seemed to get
around to reassembling.
`What brings you around, boyo?' Deane asked, offering
Case a narrow bonbon wrapped in blue-and-white checked pa-
per.  `Try one.  Ting Ting Djahe, the very best.'  Case refused
the ginger, took a seat in a yawing wooden swivel chair, and
ran a thumb down the faded seam of one black jeans-leg.  `Julie,
I hear Wage wants to kill me.'
`Ah.  Well then.  And where did you hear this, if I may?'

Crow: This is like NFL graphics here.

`People.'
`People,' Deane said, around a ginger bonbon.  `What sort
of people?  Friends?'
Case nodded.
`Not always that easy to know who your friends are, is it?'
`I do owe him a little money, Deane.  He say anything to
you?'

Professor Bueller: Did you know that everyday someone loses a sale...

`Haven't been in touch, of late.'  Then he sighed.  `If I _did_
know, of course, I might not be in a position to tell you.  Things
being what they are, you understand.'
`Things?'

Crow: Soon you'll have all your friends hanging up on you and dreading your calls. 

`He's an important connection, Case.'
`Yeah.  He want to kill me, Julie?'
`Not that I know of.'  Deane shrugged.  They might have
been discussing the price of ginger.  `If it proves to be an
unfounded rumor, old son, you come back in a week or so and
I'll let you in on a little something out of Singapore.'
`Out of the Nan Hai Hotel, Bencoolen Street?'
`Loose lips, old son!'  Deane grinned.  The steel desk was
jammed with a fortune in debugging gear.
`Be seeing you, Julie.  I'll say hello to Wage.'
Deane's fingers came up to brush the perfect knot in his
pale silk tie.

He was less than a block from Deane's office when it hit,
the sudden cellular awareness that someone was on his ass,
and very close.
The cultivation of a certain tame paranoia was something
Case took for granted.  The trick lay in not letting it get out of
control.  But that could be quite a trick, behind a stack of
octagons.  He fought the adrenaline surge and composed his
narrow features in a mask of bored vacancy, pretending to let

the crowd carry him along.  When he saw a darkened display
window, he managed to pause by it.  The place was a surgical
boutique, closed for renovations.  With his hands in the pockets
of his jacket, he stared through the glass at a flat lozenge of
vatgrown flesh that lay on a carved pedestal of imitation jade.
The color of its skin reminded him of Zone's whores; it was
tattooed with a luminous digital display wired to a subcutaneous
chip.  Why bother with the surgery, he found himself thinking,

Catherine: Don't worry, we're with you.

while sweat coursed down his ribs, when you could just carry
the thing around in your pocket?
Without moving his head, he raised his eyes and studied
the reflection of the passing crowd.

Then Case was running, bent low, dodging between bodies.

`Rent me a gun, Shin?'

Crow: It's a long, Par 5 on the way to the nation's capital.

The boy smiled.  `Two hour.'  They stood together in the
smell of fresh raw seafood at the rear of a Shiga sushi stall.
`You come back, two hour.'
`I need one now, man.  Got anything right now?'
Shin rummaged behind empty two-liter cans that had once
been filled with powdered horseradish.  He produced a slender
package wrapped in gray plastic.  `Taser.  One hour, twenty

Crow: Yeah, thanks for helping me out there.

`Shit.  I don't need that.  I need a gun.  Like I maybe wanna
shoot somebody, understand?'

Mike: It's Goofus and Gallant.

The waiter shrugged, replacing the taser behind the horse-
radish cans.  `Two hour.'


Servo: Not this kid. ServoGee, I hope this works or little Billy will be lunch meat! 

He went into the shop without bothering to glance at the
display of shuriken.  He'd never thrown one in his life.

Servo: Free Mumia!

He bought two packs of Yeheyuans with a Mitsubishi Bank
chip that gave his name as Charles Derek May.  It beat Truman

`No,' he said, `I don't like knives.'
She brought an oblong box from beneath the counter.  The

end and a small bronze pyramid at the other.  She gripped the

forefinger, and pulled.  Three oiled, telescoping segments of
tightly wound coilspring slid out and locked.  `Cobra,' she said.

had spent ten minutes in a urinal, trying to discover a convenient
way to conceal his cobra; finally he'd settled for tucking the
handle into the waistband of his jeans, with the tube slanting
across his stomach.  The pyramidal striking tip rode between

attracted a related clientele.  Fridays and Saturdays were dif-

faded behind an influx of sailors and the specialists who preyed
on them.  As Case pushed through the doors, he looked for

resident pimp, was observing with glazed fatherly interest as
one of his girls went to work on a young sailor.  Zone was
addicted to a brand of hypnotic the Japanese called Cloud

`You seen Wage tonight, Lonny?'
Zone regarded him with his usual calm.  He shook his head.
`You sure, man?'
`Maybe in the Namban.  Maybe two hours ago.'

`See you, Lonny.'  Case left the bar.

Because, in some weird and very approximate way, it was
like a run in the matrix.  Get just wasted enough, find yourself
in some desperate but strangely arbitrary kind of trouble, and
it was possible to see Ninsei as a field of data, the way the

cell specialties.  Then you could throw yourself into a highspeed
drift and skid, totally engaged but set apart from it all, and all
around you the dance of biz, information interacting, data made
flesh in the mazes of the black market...

Mike: It's Goofus and Gallant.

Go it, Case, he told himself.  Suck 'em in.  Last thing they'll
expect.  He was half a block from the games arcade where he'd
first met Linda Lee.
He bolted across Ninsei, scattering a pack of strolling sail-
ors.  One of them screamed after him in Spanish.  Then he was
through the entrance, the sound crashing over him like surf,
subsonics throbbing in the pit of his stomach.  Someone scored
a ten-megaton hit on Tank War Europa, a simulated airburst
drowning the arcade in white sound as a lurid hologram fireball
mushroomed overhead.  He cut to the right and loped up a flight
of unpainted chipboard stairs.  He'd come here once with Wage,
to discuss a deal in proscribed hormonal triggers with a man
called Matsuga.  He remembered the hallway, its stained mat-
ting, the row of identical doors leading to tiny office cubicles.

Mike: Poor Irish—if they aren't being invaded by Cromwell or infested by leprechauns they've got this guy! 

One door was open now.  A Japanese girl in a sleeveless black
t-shirt glanced up from a white terminal, behind her head a
travel poster of Greece, Aegian blue splashed with streamlined
ideograms.
`Get your security up here,' Case told her.
Then he sprinted down the corridor, out of her sight.  The
last two doors were closed and, he assumed, locked.  He spun
and slammed the sole of his nylon running shoe into the blue-
lacquered composition door at the far end.  It popped, cheap
hardware failing from the splintered frame.  Darkness there, the
white curve of a terminal housing.  Then he was on the door
to its right, both hands around the transparent plastic knob,
leaning in with everything he had.  Something snapped, and he
was inside.  This was where he and Wage had met with Mat-
suga, but whatever front company Matsuga had operated was
long gone.  No terminal, nothing.  Light from the alley behind
the arcade, filtering in through sootblown plastic.  He made out
a snakelike loop of fiberoptics protruding from a wall socket,
a pile of discarded food containers, and the bladeless nacelle
of an electric fan.
The window was a single pane of cheap plastic.  He shrugged
out of his jacket, bundled it around his right hand, and punched.

Hunchback Fairy: My broom! I'm a witch and I can't move without it!

It split, requiring two more blows to free it from the frame.
Over the muted chaos of the games, an alarm began to cycle,
triggered either by the broken window or by the girl at the head
of the corridor.
Case turned, pulled his jacket on, and flicked the cobra to
full extension.
With the door closed, he was counting on his tail to assume
he'd gone through the one he'd kicked half off its hinges.  The
cobra's bronze pyramid began to bob gently, the spring-steel
shaft amplifying his pulse.
Nothing happened.  There was only the surging of the alarm,
the crashing of the games, his heart hammering.  When the fear
came, it was like some half-forgotten friend.  Not the cold,

He'd lived for so long on a constant edge of anxiety that he'd
almost forgotten what real fear was.
This cubicle was the sort of place where people died.  He
might die here.  They might have guns...
A crash, from the far end of the corridor.  A man's voice,
shouting something in Japanese.  A scream, shrill terror.  An-
other crash.
And footsteps, unhurried, coming closer.

snapped the cobra into its handle and scrambled for the window,
blind with fear, his nerves screaming.  He was up, out, and
falling, all before he was conscious of what he'd done.  The
impact with pavement drove dull rods of pain through his shins.
A narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch
framed a heap of discarded fiberoptics and the chassis of a
junked console.  He'd fallen face forward on a slab of soggy
chipboard; he rolled over, into the shadow of the console.  The
cubicle's window was a square of faint light.  The alarm still

still couldn't read the features.  Glint of silver across the eyes.
`Shit,' someone said, a woman, in the accent of the northern
Sprawl.
The head was gone.  Case lay under the console for a long
count of twenty, then stood up.  The steel cobra was still in his
hand, and it took him a few seconds to remember what it was.
He limped away down the alley, nursing his left ankle.

Shin's pistol was a fifty-year-old Vietnamese imitation of

the first shot, with a very rough pull.  It was chambered for .22
long rifle, and Case would've preferred lead azide explosives
to the simple Chinese hollowpoints Shin had sold him.  Still,
it was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he

his jacket pocket.  The grips were bright red plastic molded in

in the dark.  He'd consigned the cobra to a dump canister on
Ninsei and dry-swallowed another octagon.
The pill lit his circuits and he rode the rush down Shiga to
Ninsei, then over to Baiitsu.  His tail, he'd decided, was gone,
and that was fine.  He had calls to make, biz to transact, and
it wouldn't wait.  A block down Baiitsu, toward the port, stood
a featureless ten-story office building in ugly yellow brick.  Its
windows were dark now, but a faint glow from the roof was
visible if you craned your neck.  An unlit neon sign near the
main entrance offered CHEAP HOTEL under a cluster of ideo-
grams.  If the place had another name, Case didn't know it; it

climbed into the plastic cage and used his key, an unmarked
length of rigid magnetic tape.
Case had rented a coffin here, on a weekly basis, since he'd
arrived in Chiba, but he'd never slept in Cheap Hotel.  He slept
in cheaper places.
The elevator smelled of perfume and cigarettes; the sides
of the cage was scratched and thumb-smudged.  As it passed the

fifth floor, he saw the lights of Ninsei.  He drummed his fingers
against the pistolgrip as the cage slowed with a gradual hiss.
As always, it came to a full stop with a violent jolt, but he
was ready for it.  He stepped out into the courtyard that served
the place as some combination of lobby and lawn.

teenager sat behind a C-shaped console, reading a textbook.
The white fiberglass coffins were racked in a framework of
industrial scaffolding.  Six tiers of coffins, ten coffins on a side.
Case nodded in the boy's direction and limped across the plastic
grass to the nearest ladder.  The compound was roofed with
cheap laminated matting that rattled in a strong wind and leaked
when it rained, but the coffins were reasonably difficult to open
without a key.
The expansion-grate catwalk vibrated with his weight as he
edged his way along the third tier to Number 92.  The coffins
were three meters long, the oval hatches a meter wide and just
under a meter and a half tall.  He fed his key into the slot and

thudded reassuringly and the hatch rose vertically with a creak
of springs.  Fluorescents flickered on as he crawled in, pulling
the hatch shut behind him and slapping the panel that activated

the manual latch.
There was nothing in Number 92 but a standard Hitachi
pocket computer and a small white styrofoam cooler chest.  The
cooler contained the remains of three ten-kilo slabs of dry ice,

carefully wrapped in paper to delay evaporation, and a spun
aluminum lab flask.  Crouching on the brown temperfoam slab
that was both floor and bed, Case took Shin's .22 from his
pocket and put it on top of the cooler.  Then he took off his

jacket.  The coffin's terminal was molded into one concave wall,
opposite a panel listing house rules in seven languages.  Case
took the pink handset from its cradle and punched a Hongkong
number from memory.  He let it ring five times, then hung up.
His buyer for the three megabytes of hot RAM in the Hitachi
wasn't taking calls.
He punched a Tokyo number in Shinjuku.
A woman answered, something in Japanese.
`Snake Man there?'
`Very good to hear from you,' said Snake Man, coming in
on an extension.  `I've been expecting your call.'
`I got the music you wanted.'  Glancing at the cooler.
`I'm very glad to hear that.  We have a cash flow problem.
Can you front?'
`Oh, man, I really need the money bad...'
Snake Man hung up.

Manston: Hard to believe that a group of civilized men could sit around and calmly discuss how to murder five or six million others.

`You shit,' Case said to the humming receiver.  He stared
at the cheap little pistol.
`Iffy,' he said, `it's all looking very iffy tonight.'

Case walked into the Chat an hour before dawn, both hands

in the pockets of his jacket: one held the rented pistol, the other
the aluminum flask.
Ratz was at a rear table, drinking Apollonaris water from
a beer pitcher, his hundred and twenty kilos of doughy flesh
tilted against the wall on a creaking chair.  A Brazilian kid
called Kurt was on the bar, tending a thin crowd of mostly
silent drunks.  Ratz's plastic arm buzzed as he raised the pitcher
and drank.  His shaven head was filmed with sweat.  `You look
bad, friend artiste,' he said, flashing the wet ruin of his teeth.

Mike: Pow Wow the Indian boy, loved all the animals in the west... Mike, Crow and Servo: We will, we will, we will ROCK YOU! Tusk!

`I'm doing just fine,' said Case, and grinned like a skull.
`Super fine.'  He sagged into the chair opposite Ratz, hands
still in his pockets.

Mike: I think the title was supposed to be "Screaming, semicolon, Skull". 

`And you wander back and forth in this portable bombshelter
built of booze and ups, sure.  Proof against the grosser emotions,
yes?'

Artur: Also, I'd like to save those two bottles of beer. 

`Why don't you get off my case, Ratz?  You seen Wage?'
`Proof against fear and being alone,' the bartender contin-
ued.  `Listen to the fear.  Maybe it's your friend.'
`You hear anything about a fight in the arcade tonight, Ratz?

Servo: Any questions so far? 

Somebody hurt?'
`Crazy cut a security man.'  He shrugged.  `A girl, they
say.'
`I gotta talk to Wage.  Ratz, I...'
`Ah.'  Ratz's mouth narrowed, compressed into a single
line.  He was looking past Case, toward the entrance.  `I think
you are about to.'
Case had a sudden flash of the shuriken in their window.
The speed sang in his head.  The pistol in his hand was slippery

`Herr Wage,' Ratz said, slowly extending his pink manip-

flanked by his joeboys, nearly identical young men, their arms

zilian standing on the bar, aiming a Smith & Wesson riot gun
at the trio.  The thing's barrel, made of paper-thin alloy wrapped
with a kilometer of glass filament, was wide enough to swallow
a fist.  The skeletal magazine revealed five fat orange cartridges,
subsonic sandbag jellies.


`Technically nonlethal,' said Ratz.
`Hey, Ratz,' Case said, `I owe you one.'

Crow: The lawsuts begin.

The bartender shrugged.  `Nothing, you owe me.  These,'
and he glowered at Wage and the joeboys, `should know better.

Wage coughed.  `So who's talking about taking anybody

Case pulled the .22 out of his pocket and levelled it at

closed around the pistol and Case let his hand go limp.

tirely deserted except for Kurt and a drunken sailor in khakis,
who was curled at the foot of a barstool.  The barrel of the

table.  Ratz held the gun in his claw and pumped the round out
of the chamber.
`Who told you I was going to hit you, Case?' Wage asked.

Mike: Hey, wait a minute!

Linda.
`Who told you, man?  Somebody trying to set you up?'

Jim: What are you looking at? Eat your ice cream! 

The sailor moaned and vomited explosively.
`Get him out of here,' Ratz called to Kurt, who was sitting

`Yeah.'  He stood up and felt the Chat sway around him.
`Well, I had this fifty, but I gave it to somebody.'  He giggled.
He picked up the .22's magazine and the one loose cartridge
and dropped them into one pocket, then put the pistol in the
other.  `I gotta see Shin, get my deposit back.'
`Go home,' said Ratz, shifting on the creaking chair with
something like embarrassment.  `Artiste.  Go home.'
He felt them watching as he crossed the room and shouldered

On the catwalk, he had trouble with the lock.  She'd messed
it up somehow when she'd fiddled it, he thought.  Beginner.
He knew where to rent a blackbox that would open anything
in Cheap Hotel.  Fluorescents came on as he crawled in.
`Close the hatch real slow, friend.  You still got that Saturday
night special you rented from the waiter?'

Mike: Ah, you've been doing enough of that, mister! 

She sat with her back to the wall, at the far end of the coffin.
She had her knees up, resting her wrists on them; the pepperbox
muzzle of a flechette pistol emerged from her hands.
`That you in the arcade?'  He pulled the hatch down.

Bart Fargo: You know, Scarface, that was a very silly get-up. It didn't suit you. And your imitation of a waiter was very funny. "Your breakfast, señor..." You should have changed your voice too. 

`Where's Linda?'
`Hit that latch switch.'

`That your girl?  Linda?'
He nodded.
`She's gone.  Took your Hitachi.  Real nervous kid.  What

were black, the heels of black boots deep in the temperfoam.
`I took it back to Shin, got my deposit.  Sold his bullets

`No.'
`Want some dry ice?  All I got, right now.'

off her black jacket; the fletcher hung beneath her arm in a
black nylon shoulder rig.  She wore a sleeveless gray pullover
with plain steel zips across each shoulder.  Bulletproof.  Case
decided, slopping coffee into a bright red mug.  His arms and
legs felt like they were made out of wood.
`Case.'  He looked up, seeing the man for the first time.
`My name is Armitage.'  The dark robe was open to the waist,
the broad chest hairless and muscular, the stomach flat and
hard.  Blue eyes so pale they made Case think of bleach.  `Sun's
up, Case.  This is your lucky day, boy.'
Case whipped his arm sideways and the man easily ducked
the scalding coffee.  Brown stain running down the imitation
ricepaper wall.  He saw the angular gold ring through the left
lobe.  Special Forces.  The man smiled.
`Get your coffee, Case,' Molly said.  `You re okay, but
you're not going anywhere 'til Armitage has his say.'  She sat
crosslegged on a silk futon and began to fieldstrip the fletcher
without bothering to look at it.  Twin mirrors tracking as he
crossed to the table and refilled his cup.

Crow: Hey, lady!

A heavy gold bracelet flashed on his wrist.  `Leningrad, Kiev,
Siberia.  We invented you in Siberia, Case.'
`What's that supposed to mean?'
`Screaming Fist, Case.  You've heard the name.'

Crow: Forty percent of car accidents are caused by... women's hinders!

nexus with virus programs.  Yeah, I heard about it.  And nobody
got out.'
He sensed abrupt tension.  Armitage walked to the window
and looked out over Tokyo Bay.  `That isn't true.  One unit
made it back to Helsinki, Case.'
Case shrugged, sipped coffee.
`You're a console cowboy.  The prototypes of the programs

`Icebreakers,' Case said, over the rim of the red mug.

Servo: Nobody home, huh?

`Ice from _ICE,_ intrusion countermeasures electronics.'

Crow: Yes! For God's sakes, yes! 

`Problem is, mister, I'm no jockey now, so I think I'll just
be going...'
`I was there, Case; I was there when they invented your
kind.'
`You got zip to do with me and my kind buddy.  You're
rich enough to hire expensive razorgirls to haul my ass up here,
is all.  I'm never gonna punch any deck again, not for you or
anybody else.'  He crossed to the window and looked down.

Grandpa: Uh-oh!

`That's where I live now.'
`Our profile says you're trying to con the street into killing
you when you're not looking.'
`Profile?'
`We've built up a detailed model.  Bought a go-to for each
of your aliases and ran the skim through some military software.
You're suicidal, Case.  The model gives you a month on the
outside.  And our medical projection says you'll need a new
pancreas inside a year.'
``We.''  He met the faded blue eyes.  ``We' who?'
`What would you say if I told you we could correct your
neural damage, Case?'  Armitage suddenly looked to Case as
if he were carved from a block of metal; inert, enormously
heavy.  A statue.  He knew now that this was a dream, and that
soon he'd wake.  Armitage wouldn't speak again.  Case's dreams

always ended in these freezeframes, and now this one was
over.
`What would you say, Case?'
Case looked out over the Bay and shivered.

Joel: Just try to pay no attention to that girl behind the curtain.

`I'd say you were full of shit.'
Armitage nodded.
`Then I'd ask what your terms were.'
`Not very different than what you're used to, Case.'
`Let the man get some sleep, Armitage,' Molly said from

her futon, the components of the fletcher spread on the silk
like some expensive puzzle.  `He's coming apart at the seams.'
`Terms,' Case said, `and now.  Right now.'
He was still shivering.  He couldn't stop shivering.


Joel: The god of decaffeinated coffee.

The clinic was nameless, expensively appointed, a cluster
of sleek pavilions separated by small formal gardens.  He re-
membered the place from the round he'd made his first month
in Chiba.
`Scared, Case.  You're real scared.'  It was Sunday afternoon
and he stood with Molly in a sort of courtyard.  White boulders,

Jimmy: But... I accuse my parents! 

a stand of green bamboo, black gravel raked into smooth waves.
A gardener, a thing like a large metal crab, was tending the
bamboo.
`It'll work Case.  You got no idea, the kind of stuff Ar-
mitage has.  Like he's gonna pay these nerve boys for fixing
you with the program he's giving them to tell them how to do
it.  He'll put them three years ahead of the competition.  You
got any idea what that's worth?'  She hooked thumbs in the
beltloops of her leather jeans and rocked backward on the
lacquered heels of cherry red cowboy boots.  The narrow toes
were sheathed in bright Mexican silver.  The lenses were empty
quicksilver, regarding him with an insect calm.
`You're street samurai,' he said.  `How long you work for
him?'
`Couple of months.'

Servo: Don Was? The producer? 

`What about before that?'
`For somebody else.  Working girl, you know?'

Merlin: Don't I get a kiss?

He nodded.
`Funny, Case.'
`What's funny?'
`It's like I know you.  That profile he's got.  I know how
you're wired.'

Mrs. Forrester: That's it, we're pulling out! 

`You don't know me, sister.'
`You're okay, Case.  What got you, it's just called bad luck.'

Crow: "Stacked" means you're really smart.

`How about him?  He okay, Molly?'  The robot crab moved

Kay: Oh, I've been hearing about that. Yes, I'd like to very much.

toward them, picking its way over the waves of gravel.  Its
bronze carapace might have been a thousand years old.  When
it was within a meter of her boots, it fired a burst of light, then
froze for an instant, analyzing data obtained.
`What I always think about first, Case, is my own sweet
ass.'  The crab had altered course to avoid her, but she kicked
it with a smooth precision, the silver boot-tip clanging on the
carapace.  The thing fell on its back, but the bronze limbs soon
righted it.
Case sat on one of the boulders, scuffing at the symmetry

of the gravel waves with the toes of his shoes.  He began to
search his pockets for cigarettes.  `In your shirt,' she said.
`You want to answer my question?'  He fished a wrinkled
Yeheyuan from the pack and she lit it for him with a thin slab
of German steel that looked as though it belonged on an op-
erating table.

Mike: Save a place for me at your dinner table!

`Well, I'll tell you, the man's definitely on to something.
He's got big money now, and he's never had it before, and he
gets more all the time.'  Case noticed a certain tension around
her mouth.  `Or maybe, maybe something's on to him...'

Paul: "Stacked"?

She shrugged.
`What's that mean?'

Joel: Isn't it kind of weird? It's like, there's a guy in a gorilla suit, and there's— he's got a robot head, and inside he's got kind of a bunch of clay… I mean, I've seen Dali paintings that make more sense than this movie does.

`I don't know, exactly.  I know I don't know who or what
we're really working for.'
He stared at the twin mirrors.  Leaving the Hilton, Saturday
morning, he'd gone back to Cheap Hotel and slept for ten hours.
Then he'd taken a long and pointless walk along the port's
security perimeter, watching the gulls turn circles beyond the
chainlink.  If she'd followed him, she'd done a good job of it.
He'd avoided Night City.  He'd waited in the coffin for Ar-
mitage's call.  Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this
girl with a gymnast's body and conjurer's hands.
`If you'll come in now, sir, the anesthetist is waiting to
meet you.'  The technician bowed, turned, and reentered the
clinic without waiting to see if Case would follow.

Cold steel odor.  Ice caressed his spine.
Lost, so small amid that dark, hands grown cold, body image
fading down corridors of television sky.

and the prison of the skull.

Mike: Hundreds of Men Flock to Crime Scene! 

Goddamn don't you move.
Where the sky faded from hissing static to the noncolor of
the matrix, and he glimpsed the shuriken, his stars.
`Stop it, Case, I gotta find your vein!'

Kay: You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to teach.

She was straddling his chest, a blue plastic syrette in one
hand.  `You don't lie still, I'll slit your fucking throat.  You're
still full of endorphin inhibitors.'

He woke and found her stretched beside him in the dark.
His neck was brittle, made of twigs.  There was a steady

Servo: See, Buzz? It's really fun to be psychotic.  JoelMom, Dad, tell me you heard that!

`Case?  It's Wednesday, Case.'  She moved, rolling over,
reaching across him.  A breast brushed his upper arm.  He heard
her tear the foil seal from a bottle of water and drink.  `Here.'

Crow: Whoa, Milton Berle there... 

She put the bottle in his hand.  `I can see in the dark, Case.

Joel: Is golden!

`My back hurts.'
`That's where they replaced your fluid.  Changed your blood,

And some new tissue patched into your liver.  The nerve stuff,
I dunno.  Lot of injections.  They didn't have to open anything
up for the main show.'  She settled back beside him.  `It's
2:43:12 AM, Case.  Got a readout chipped into my optic nerve.'
He sat up and tried to sip from the bottle.  Gagged, coughed,
lukewarm water spraying his chest and thighs.
`I gotta punch deck,' he heard himself say.  He was groping
for his clothes.  `I gotta know...'

Natalie: My mom! He's done something to my mom!

She laughed.  Small strong hands gripped his upper arms.

Servo: What?

`Sorry, hotshot.  Eight day wait.  Your nervous system would
fall out on the floor if you jacked in now.  Doctor's orders.
Besides, they figure it worked.  Check you in a day or so.'  He
lay down again.
`Where are we?'
`Home.  Cheap Hotel.'
`Where's Armitage?'

Crow: So, drink rum constantly. 

`Hilton, selling beads to the natives or something.  We're
out of here soon, man.  Amsterdam, Paris, then back to the
Sprawl.'  She touched his shoulder.  `Roll over.  I give a good
massage.'
He lay on his stomach, arms stretched forward, tips of his

fingers against the walls of the coffin.  She settled over the
small of his back, kneeling on the temperfoam, the leather
jeans cool against his skin.  Her fingers brushed his neck.
`How come you're not at the Hilton?'
She answered him by reaching back, between his thighs,
and gently encircling his scrotum with thumb and forefinger.
She rocked there for a minute in the dark, erect above him,
her other hand on his neck.  The leather of her jeans creaked
softly with the movement.  Case shifted, feeling himself harden
against the temperfoam.
His head throbbed, but the brittleness in his neck seemed
to retreat.  He raised himself on one elbow, rolled, sank back
against the foam, pulling her down, licking her breasts, small
hard nipples sliding wet across his cheek.  He found the zip on

down on him again and again, until they both had come, his

hurricane corridors, and her inner thighs were strong and wet

against his hips.

On Ninsei, a thinner, weekday version of the crowd went
through the motions of the dance.  Waves of sound rolled from
the arcades and pachinko parlors.  Case glanced into the Chat
and saw Zone watching over his girls in the warm, beer-smell-
ing twilight.  Ratz was tending bar.
`You seen Wage, Ratz?'
`Not tonight.'  Ratz made a point of raising an eyebrow at

Crow: About face! Crap in hands! Fling crap!

Molly.
`You see him, tell him I got his money.'
`Luck changing, my artiste?'
`Too soon to tell.'

`Well, I gotta see this guy,' Case said, watching his re-
flection in her glasses.  `I got biz to cancel out of.'
`Armitage won't like it, I let you out of my sight.'  She
stood beneath Deane's melting clock, hands on her hips.
`The guy won't talk to me if you're there.  Deane I don't
give two shits about.  He takes care of himself.  But I got people
who'll just go under if I walk out of Chiba cold.  It's my people,
you know?'
Her mouth hardened.  She shook her head.
`I got people in Singapore, Tokyo connections in Shinjuku
and Asakuza, and they'll go _down,_ understand?' he lied, his
hand on the shoulder of her black jacket.  `Five.  Five minutes.
By your clock, okay?'

Mike: Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

`Not what I'm paid for.'
`What you're paid for is one thing.  Me letting some tight

`Bullshit.  Tight friends my ass.  You're going in there to

on the dust-covered Kandinsky coffee table.
`Ah, Case, sport, it does look as though your companion

silicon in her head.  What is this about, exactly?'  Deane's ghostly
cough seemed to hang in the air between them.
`Hold on, Julie.  Anyway, I'll be coming in alone.'

other way.'

out, past the stacked white modules of preserved ginger.
`Keeping stranger company than usual, Case?' asked Julie.
`Julie, she's gone.  You wanna let me in?  Please, Julie?'

Servo: Guys, just skip the music and go right to the heroin. 

The bolts worked.  `Slowly, Case,' said the voice.
`Turn on the works, Julie, all the stuff in the desk,' Case
said, taking his place in the swivel chair.
`It's on all the time,' Deane said mildly, taking a gun from
behind the exposed works of his old mechanical typewriter and

aiming it carefully at Case.  It was a belly gun, a magnum
revolver with the barrel sawn down to a nub.  The front of the
trigger guard had been cut away and the grips wrapped with
what looked like old masking tape.  Case thought it looked very
strange in Dean's manicured pink hands.  `Just taking care, you
understand.  Nothing personal.  Now tell me what you want.'

Narrator: Brush, and brush, and brush—at least 100 strokes.

`I need a history lesson, Julie.  And a go-to on somebody.'
`What's moving, old son?'  Deane's shirt was candy-striped
cotton, the collar white and rigid, like porcelain.
`Me, Julie.  I'm leaving.  Gone.  But do me the favor, okay?'
`Go-to on whom, old son?'

Servo: Aw, Steven Bochco? Does this mean we have to see Denis Franz's hairy butt cheeks?

`Gaijin name of Armitage, suite in the Hilton.'

Servo: Hal Needham was brought in to direct this scene. 

Deane put the pistol down.  `Sit still, Case.'  He tapped
something out on a lap terminal.  `It seems as though you know

Joel: Hmm-hmm-hmm, that's you!

as much as my net does, Case.  This gentleman seems to have
a temporary arrangement with the Yakuza, and the sons of the
neon chrysanthemum have ways of screening their allies from
the likes of me.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  Now, history.

Fingal: I can't take this anymore... I'm so bored! 

You said history.'  He picked up the gun again, but didn't point
it directly at Case.  `What sort of history?'
`The war.  You in the war, Julie?'
`The war?  What's there to know?  Lasted three weeks.'
`Screaming Fist.'
`Famous.  Don't they teach you history these days?  Great

shrugged.  `Turkey shoot for Ivan.'
`Any of those guys make it out?'
`Christ,' Deane said, `it's been bloody years...  Though
I do think a few did.  One of the teams.  Got hold of a Sov
gunship.  Helicopter, you know.  Flew it back to Finland.  Didn't
have entry codes, of course, and shot hell out of the Finnish
defense forces in the process.  Special Forces types.'  Deane
sniffed.  `Bloody hell.'
Case nodded.  The smell of preserved ginger was over-
whelming.
`I spent the war in Lisbon, you know,' Deane said, putting
the gun down.  `Lovely place, Lisbon.'
`In the service, Julie?'
`Hardly.  Though I did see action.'  Deane smiled his pink
smile.  `Wonderful what a war can do for one's markets.'
`Thanks, Julie.  I owe you one.'

Servo: So, eight 5¼" floppies hold the keys to time travel.

`Hardly, Case.  And goodbye.'

And later he'd tell himself that the evening at Sammi's had
felt wrong from the start, that even as he'd followed Molly

They'd gone to the Namban, after he'd seen Deane, and

paid off his debt to Wage with a roll of Armitage's New Yen.

Joel: Hey, look — I know you're an evil hellbeast, but could you hold it down?! It's after nine, and we got kids! 

Wage had liked that, his boys had liked it less, and Molly had
grinned at Case's side with a kind of ecstatic feral intensity,
obviously longing for one of them to make a move.  Then he'd
taken her back to the Chat for a drink.

Servo: Emby Mellay? That's not a name, it's a bad Scrabble hand. 

`Wasting your time, cowboy,' Molly said, when Case took
an octagon from the pocket of his jacket.
`How's that?  You want one?'  He held the pill out to her.
`Your new pancreas, Case, and those plugs in your liver.
Armitage had them designed to bypass that shit.'  She tapped
the octagon with one burgundy nail.  `You're biochemically
incapable of getting off on amphetamine or cocaine.'
`Shit,' he said.  He looked at the octagon, then at her.

Mike: Yes, my plan is perfect. I've been spotted by several people and I killed a guy!

`Eat it.  Eat a dozen.  Nothing'll happen.'

Crow: And then he died!  

He did.  Nothing did.
Three beers later, she was asking Ratz about the fights.
`Sammi's,' Ratz said.

Mike: Do you? DO YOU?

`I'll pass,' Case said, `I hear they kill each other down
there.'
An hour later, she was buying tickets from a skinny Thai
in a white t-shirt and baggy rugby shorts.

Mike: Oh, the big one! Okay.Oh, wow! Great sweater, Gyps. Thanks!Look at that, it says "Joike" on it.

None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the

contemplation of the dance.
He didn't like this place.

Servo: Hey, I'm experiencing a sensation altogether new to me, and frankly... I LOVE IT! 

He turned and walked back into the shadows.  Too dark.

Servo: ...right there!

Too quiet.
The crowd, he saw, was mostly Japanese.  Not really a Night
City crowd.  Techs down from the arcologies.  He supposed that
meant the arena had the approval of some corporate recreational
committee.  He wondered briefly what it would be like, working
all your life for one zaibatsu.  Company housing, company
hymn, company funeral.
He'd made nearly a full circuit of the dome before he found
the food stalls.  He bought yakitori on skewers and two tall
waxy cartons of beer.  Glancing up at the holograms, he saw

Servo: And three quarters into the movie, Maciste finally does something! 

that blood laced one figure's chest.  Thick brown sauce trickled
down the skewers and over his knuckles.
Seven days and he'd jack in.  If he closed his eyes now,
he'd see the matrix.
Shadows twisted as the holograms swung through their dance.
Then the fear began to knot between his shoulders.  A cold
trickle of sweat worked its way down and across his ribs.  The
operation hadn't worked.  He was still here, still meat, no Molly
waiting, her eyes locked on the circling knives, no Armitage
waiting in the Hilton with tickets and a new passport and
money.  It was all some dream, some pathetic fantasy...  Hot
tears blurred his vision.
Blood sprayed from a jugular in a red gout of light.  And

Raw edge of vomit in his throat.  He closed his eyes, took
a deep breath, opened them, and saw Linda Lee step past him,
her gray eyes blind with fear.  She wore the same French fa-

over him.  Above the stage, a figure turned, knife held high,
to the cheering crowd.  The boy smiled and drew something
from his sleeve.  A razor, etched in red as a third beam blinked
past them into the dark.  Case saw the razor dipping for his
throat like a dowser's wand.
The face was erased in a humming cloud of microscopic

cooked meat.  The crowd was chanting the winner's name.  A
beer vendor was wiping his taps with a dark rag.  One white
sneaker had come off, somehow, and lay beside her head.
Follow the wall.  Curve of concrete.  Hands in pockets.  Keep
walking.  Past unseeing faces, every eye raised to the victor's
image above the ring.  Once a seamed European face danced
in the glare of a match, lips pursed around the short stem of a
metal pipe.  Tang of hashish.  Case walked on, feeling nothing.

Servo: Now I think he's just the incredibly resilient man. 

`Case.'  Her mirrors emerged from deeper shadow.  `You
okay?'
Something mewled and bubbled in the dark behind her.
He shook his head.

Mike: Washingtonland, the new Disney theme park! 

`Fight's over, Case.  Time to go home.'

Joel: I invented that move.

He tried to walk past her, back into the dark, where some-
thing was dying.  She stopped him with a hand on his chest.
`Friends of your tight friend.  Killed your girl for you.  You
haven't done too well for friends in this town, have you?  We
got a partial profile on that old bastard when we did you, man.

Servo: Jeez, the Mengele Institute for Marine Research! 

He'd fry anybody, for a few New ones.  The one back there
said they got on to her when she was trying to fence your RAM.
Just cheaper for them to kill her and take it.  Save a little
money...  I got the one who had the laser to tell me all about
it.  Coincidence we were here, but I had to make sure.'  Her
mouth was hard, lips pressed into a thin line.
Case felt as though his brain were jammed.  `Who,' he said,
`who sent them?'

Crow: Eight… miles… wrong!

She passed him a blood-flecked bag of preserved ginger.
He saw that her hands were sticky with blood.  Back in the
shadows, someone made wet sounds and died.

After the postoperative check at the clinic, Molly took him
to the port.  Armitage was waiting.  He'd chartered a hovercraft.
The last Case saw of Chiba were the dark angles of the arcol-
ogies.  Then a mist closed over the black water and the drifting
shoals of waste.

parks ringing the old core of Atlanta...

Case woke from a dream of airports, of Molly's dark leathers
moving ahead of him through the concourses of Narita, Schipol,
Orly...  He watched himself buy a flat plastic flask of Danish
vodka at some kiosk, an hour before dawn.
Somewhere down in the Sprawl's ferro-concrete roots, a
train drove a column of stale air through a tunnel.  The train
itself was silent, gliding over its induction cushion, but dis-
placed air made the tunnel sing, bass down into subsonics.
Vibration reached the room where he lay and caused dust to
rise from the cracks in the dessicated parquet floor.
Opening his eyes, he saw Molly, naked and just out of reach
across an expanse of very new pink temperfoam.  Overhead,
sunlight filtered through the soot-stained grid of a skylight.
One half-meter square of glass had been replaced with chip-
board, a fat gray cable emerging there to dangle within a few

functional elegance of a war plane's fusilage.  Her body was

spare, neat, the muscles like a dancer's.
The room was large.  He sat up.  The room was empty, aside
from the wide pink bedslab and two nylon bags, new and
identical, that lay beside it.  Blank walls, no windows, a single
white-painted steel firedoor.  The walls were coated with count-
less layers of white latex paint.  Factory space.  He knew this

He was home.

cryptic foray, the two of them walking alone past Dam Square
to a bar she knew on a Damrak thoroughfare.  Paris was a
blurred dream.  Shopping.  She'd taken him shopping.
He stood, pulling on a wrinkled pair of new black jeans that
lay at his feet, and knelt beside the bags.  The first one he
opened was Molly's: neatly folded clothing and small expen-
sive-looking gadgets.  The second was stuffed with things he
didn't remember buying: books, tapes, a simstim deck, clothing
with French and Italian labels.  Beneath a green t-shirt, he
discovered a flat, origami-wrapped package, recycled Japanese
paper.
The paper tore when he picked it up; a bright nine-pointed
star fell -- to stick upright in a crack in the parquet.
`Souvenir,' Molly said.  `I noticed you were always looking

at 'em.'  He turned and saw her sitting crosslegged on the bed,
sleepily scratching her stomach with burgundy nails.

`Someone's coming later to secure the place,' Armitage
said.  He stood in the open doorway with an old-fashioned
magnetic key in his hand.  Molly was making coffee on a tiny
German stove she took from her bag.
`I can do it,' she said.  `I got enough gear already.  Infrascan
perimeter, screamers...'
`No,' he said, closing the door.  `I want it tight.'
`Suit yourself.'  She wore a dark mesh t-shirt tucked into
baggy black cotton pants.
`You ever the heat, Mr.~ Armitage?' Case asked, from where

he sat, his back against a wall.
Armitage was no taller than Case, but with his broad shoul-
ders and military posture he seemed to fill the doorway.  He
wore a somber Italian suit; in his right hand he held a briefcase
of soft black calf.  The Special Forces earring was gone.  The

handsome, inexpressive features offered the routine beauty of
the cosmetic boutiques, a conservative amalgam of the past
decade's leading media faces.  The pale glitter of his eyes
heightened the effect of a mask.  Case began to regret the ques-
tion.
`Lots of Forces types wound up cops, I mean.  Or corporate
security,' Case added uncomfortably.  Molly handed him a
steaming mug of coffee.  `That number you had them do on
my pancreas, that's like a cop routine.'
Armitage closed the door and crossed the room, to stand in
front of Case.  `You're a lucky boy, Case.  You should thank
me.'
`Should I?'  Case blew noisily on his coffee.
`You needed a new pancreas.  The one we bought for you

`Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.'
`Good, because you have a new one.'
`How's that?'  Case looked up from his coffee.  Armitage

was smiling.
`You have fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of various
main arteries, Case.  They're dissolving.  Very slowly, but they
definitely are dissolving.  Each one contains a mycotoxin.  You're
already familiar with the effect of that mycotoxin.  It was the
one your former employers gave you in Memphis.'
Case blinked up at the smiling mask.
`You have time to do what I'm hiring you for, Case, but
that's all.  Do the job and I can inject you with an enzyme that
will dissolve the bond without opening the sacs.  Then you'll

need a blood change.  Otherwise, the sacs melt and you're back
where I found you.  So you see, Case, you need us.  You need
us as badly as you did when we scraped you up from the gutter.'
Case looked at Molly.  She shrugged.
`Now go down to the freight elevator and bring up the cases
you find there.'  Armitage handed him the magnetic key.  `Go
on.  You'll enjoy this, Case.  Like Christmas morning.'

Summer in the Sprawl, the mall crowds swaying like wind-
blown grass, a field of flesh shot through with sudden eddies
of need and gratification.

concrete fountain, letting the endless stream of faces recapi-

fighting on a rooftop at seventeen, silent combat in the rose
glow of the dawn geodesics.
He shifted on the concrete, feeling it rough and cool through
the thin black denim.  Nothing here like the electric dance of
Ninsei.  This was different commerce, a different rhythm, in
the smell of fast food and perfume and fresh summer sweat.
With his deck waiting, back in the loft, an Ono-Sendai

white forms of the foam packing units, with crumpled plastic
film and hundreds of tiny foam beads.  The Ono-Sendai; next
year's most expensive Hosaka computer; a Sony monitor; a
dozen disks of corporate-grade ice; a Braun coffeemaker.  Ar-
mitage had only waited for Case's approval of each piece.
`Where'd he go?'  Case had asked Molly.
`He likes hotels.  Big ones.  Near airports, if he can manage
it.  Let's go down to the street.'  She'd zipped herself into an
old surplus vest with a dozen oddly shaped pockets and put on

her mirrored insets.
`You know about that toxin shit, before?' he asked her, by
the fountain.  She shook her head.  `You think it's true?'

Crow: Designing Women, the lost episodes.

`Maybe, maybe not.  Works either way.'
`You know any way I can find out?'
`No,' she said, her right hand coming up to form the jive
for silence.  `That kind of kink's too subtle to show up on a
scan.'  Then her fingers moved again: wait.  `And you don't
care that much anyway.  I saw you stroking that Sendai; man,
it was pornographic.'  She laughed.
`So what's he got on you?  How's he got the working girl
kinked?'
`Professional pride, baby, that's all.'  And again the sign
for silence.  `We're gonna get some breakfast, okay?  Eggs, real
bacon.  Probably kill you, you been eating that rebuilt Chiba

and get us a real breakfast.'

Lifeless neon spelled out METRO HOLOGRAFIX in dusty

had lodged between his front teeth.  He'd given up asking her
where they were going and why; jabs in the ribs and the sign

season's fashions, about sports, about a political scandal in
California he'd never heard of.
He looked around the deserted dead end street.  A sheet of

newsprint went cartwheeling past the intersection.  Freak winds
in the East side; something to do with convection, and an
overlap in the domes.  Case peered through the window at the
dead sign.  Her Sprawl wasn't his Sprawl, he decided.  She'd
led him through a dozen bars and clubs he'd never seen before,
taking care of business, usually with no more than a nod.
Maintaining connections.
Something was moving in the shadows behind METRO

The door was a sheet of corrugated roofing.  In front of it,
Molly's hands flowed through an intricate sequence of jive that
he couldn't follow.  He caught the sign for _cash,_ a thumb brush-

alloy tubing.  An enormous pile of old magazines had cascaded
into the open area, flesh of lost summers staring blindly up as
he followed her back through a narrow canyon of impacted
scrap.  He heard the door close behind them.  He didn't look
back.
The tunnel ended with an ancient Army blanket tacked across
a doorway.  White light flooded out as Molly ducked past it.

a handgun of some kind in his left hand.  He peered at them,

`What about?'
`What we're doing.'
`What are we doing?'
`Working for Armitage.'
`And you're saying this isn't for his benefit?'
`Yeah.  I saw your profile, Case.  And I've seen the rest of

`No.'  He watched his reflection in her glasses.  `I could.  I

`Sense/Net.  Paid him mega, you bet your ass.'
`Quine dead too?'
`No such luck.  He's in Europe.  He doesn't come into this.'

`What for?'
`I haven't got a clue.  Know I'm fitting Moll for a broadcast
rig, though, so it's probably her sensorium you'll access.'  The
Finn scratched his chin.  `So now you get to find out just how
tight those jeans really are, huh?'

forehead, watching motes dance in the diluted sunlight that
filtered through the grid overhead.  A countdown was in pro-
gress in one corner of the monitor screen.
Cowboys didn't get into simstim, he thought, because it
was basically a meat toy.  He knew that the trodes he used and
the little plastic tiara dangling from a simstim deck were bas-
ically the same, and that the cyberspace matrix was actually a
drastic simplification of the human sensorium, at least in terms
of presentation, but simstim itself struck him as a gratuitous
multiplication of flesh input.  The commercial stuff was edited,
of course, so that if Tally Isham got a headache in the course
of a segment, you didn't feel it.

Booths lined a central hall.  The clientele were young, few of
them out of their teens.  They all seemed to have carbon sockets
planted behind the left ear, but she didn't focus on them.  The
counters that fronted the booths displayed hundreds of slivers
of microsoft, angular fragments of colored silicon mounted
under oblong transparent bubbles on squares of white card-
board.  Molly went to the seventh booth along the south wall.
Behind the counter a boy with a shaven head stared vacantly
into space, a dozen spikes of microsoft protruding from the
socket behind his ear.

him.  The boy's eyes focused.  He sat up in his chair and pried

into his head.  His eyes narrowed.

`Tell your partner to go.'

Mike: Just leave the Bronx.

of the Sprawl at the speed of light: entire subcultures could rise
overnight, thrive for a dozen weeks, and then vanish utterly.
`Go,' he said.  The Hosaka had accessed its array of libraries,
journals, and news services.
The precis began with a long hold on a color still that Case
at first assumed was a collage of some kind, a boy's face
snipped from another image and glued to a photograph of a
paint-scrawled wall.  Dark eyes, epicanthic folds obviously the

of the extent to which media divorce the act of terrorism from
the original sociopolitical intent...'
`Skip it,' Case said.

Case met his first Modern two days after he'd screened the
Hosaka's precis.  The Moderns, he'd decided, were a contem-
porary version of the Big Scientists of his own late teens.  There
was a kind of ghostly teenage DNA at work in the Sprawl,
something that carried the coded precepts of various short-lived
subcults and replicated them at odd intervals.  The Panther Mod-
erns were a softhead variant on the Scientists.  If the technology
had been available, the Big Scientists would all have had sock-
ets stuffed with microsofts.  It was the style that mattered and
the style was the same.  The Moderns were mercenaries, prac-
tical jokers, nihilistic technofetishists.
The one who showed up at the loft door with a box of
diskettes from the Finn was a soft-voiced boy called Angelo.
His face was a simple graft grown on collagen and shark-
cartilage polysaccharides, smooth and hideous.  It was one of
the nastiest pieces of elective surgery Case had ever seen.  When
Angelo smiled, revealing the razor-sharp canines of some large
animal, Case was actually relieved.  Toothbud transplants.  He'd
seen that before.
`You can't let the little pricks generation-gap you,' Molly
said.  Case nodded, absorbed in the patterns of the Sense/Net
ice.
This was it.  This was what he was, who he was, his being.
He forgot to eat.  Molly left cartons of rice and foam trays of
sushi on the corner of the long table.  Sometimes he resented

having to leave the deck to use the chemical toilet they'd set
up in a corner of the loft.  Ice patterns formed and reformed on
the screen as he probed for gaps, skirted the most obvious
traps, and mapped the route he'd take through Sense/Net's ice.
It was good ice.  Wonderful ice.  Its patterns burned there while

maze was the first thing he saw when he woke.  He'd go straight
to the deck, not bothering to dress, and jack in.  He was cutting
it.  He was working.  He lost track of days.
And sometimes, falling asleep, particularly when Molly was
off on one of her reconnaissance trips with her rented cadre of
Moderns, images of Chiba came flooding back.  Faces and

Ninsei neon.  Once he woke from a confused dream of Linda
Lee, unable to recall who she was or what she'd ever meant
to him.  When he did remember, he jacked in and worked for
nine straight hours.
The cutting of Sense/Net's ice took a total of nine days.
`I said a week,' Armitage said, unable to conceal his sat-
isfaction when Case showed him his plan for the run.  `You
took your own good time.'
`Balls,' Case said, smiling at the screen.  `That's good work,

`Love you, Cat Mother,' whispered the Panther Modern's
link man.  His voice was modulated static in Case's headset.
`Atlanta, Brood.  Looks go.  Go, got it?'  Molly's voice was
slightly clearer.
`To hear is to obey.'  The Moderns were using some kind
of chickenwire dish in New Jersey to bounce the link man's
scrambled signal off a Sons of Christ the King satellite in
geosynchronous orbit above Manhattan.  They chose to regard
the entire operation as an elaborate private joke, and their
choice of comsats seemed to have been deliberate.  Molly's
signals were being beamed up from a one-meter umbrella dish

to Chicago to Denver, five minutes for each city.  If anyone
managed to intercept Molly's signal, unscramble it, synth her

radio, the simstim unit, and the scrambler.  The throat mike,
glued to her neck, looked as much as possible like an analgesic

like a trick deck.  Take a card, he thought, any card.
The gate blurred past.  He laughed.  The Sense/Net ice had
accepted his entry as a routine transfer from the consortium's
Los Angeles complex.  He was inside.  Behind him, viral sub-
programs peeled off, meshing with the gate's code fabric, ready
to deflect the real Los Angeles data when it arrived.

Strickland: "...the light of the wicked shall be put out..."

He flipped again.  Molly was strolling past the enormous

Servo: Thank you, El Paso! Good night! We're out of here!


Case hit the switch as his program surged through the gates
of the subsystem that controlled security for the Sense/Net
research library.  He found himself stepping into an elevator.
`Excuse me, but are you an employee?'  The guard raised
his eyebrows.  Molly popped her gum.  `No,' she said, driving
the first two knuckles of her right hand into the man's solar
plexus.  As he doubled over, clawing for the beeper on his belt,
she slammed his head sideways, against the wall of the elevator.
Chewing a little more rapidly now, she touched CLOSE
DOOR and STOP on the illuminated panel.  She took a blackbox
from her coat pocket and inserted a lead in the keyhole of the
lock that secured the panel's circuitry.

The Panther Moderns allowed four minutes for their first
move to take effect, then injected a second carefully prepared
dose of misinformation.  This time, they shot it directly into
the Sense/Net building's internal video system.
At 12:04:03, every screen in the building strobed for eigh-
teen seconds in a frequency that produced seizures in a sus-
ceptible segment of Sense/Net employees.  Then something only
vaguely like a human face filled the screens, its features stretched
across asymmetrical expanses of bone like some obscene Mer-

cator projection.  Blue lips parted wetly as the twisted, elongated
jaw moved.  Something, perhaps a hand, a thing like a reddish
clump of gnarled roots, fumbled toward the camera, blurred,
and vanished.  Subliminally rapid images of contamination:
graphics of the building's water supply system, gloved hands
manipulating laboratory glassware, something tumbling down

Case triggered his second program.  A carefully engineered
virus attacked the code fabric screening primary custodial com-
mands for the sub-basement that housed the Sense/Net research
materials.  `Boston,' Molly's voice came across the link, `I'm

exactly the shade of her pale ankle, was secured there with
micropore.  She knelt and peeled the tape away.  Streaks of
burgundy flickered across the mimetic polycarbon as she un-
folded the Modern suit.  She removed the pink raincoat, threw
it down beside the white pants, and began to pull the suit on
over the white mesh top.
12:06:26.
Case's virus had bored a window through the library's com-
mand ice.  He punched himself through and found an infinite
blue space ranged with color-coded spheres strung on a tight
grid of pale blue neon.  In the nonspace of the matrix, the interior
of a given data construct possessed unlimited subjective di-
mension; a child's toy calculator, accessed through Case's Sen-
dai, would have presented limitless gulfs of nothingness hung
with a few basic commands.  Case began to key the sequence
the Finn had purchased from a mid-eschelon sarariman with
severe drug problems.  He began to glide through the spheres
as if he were on invisible tracks.

Mike: Honey, I can't stop smiling, I'm in hell!

Crow: Hit me!

Punching his way into the sphere, chill blue neon vault above

ing foam barricades now,' one noted, speaking for the benefit
of his throat mike.  `Rapids are still trying to land their copter.'

Case hit the simstim switch.  And flipped into the agony of
broken bone.  Molly was braced against the blank gray wall of
a long corridor, her breath coming ragged and uneven.  Case
was back in the matrix instantly, a white-hot line of pain fading
in his left thigh.
`What's happening, Brood?' he asked the link man.
`I dunno, Cutter.  Mother's not talking.  Wait.'
Case's program was cycling.  A single hair-fine thread of
crimson neon extended from the center of the restored window
to the shifting outline of his icebreaker.  He didn't have time
to wait.  Taking a deep breath, he flipped again.
Molly took a single step, trying to support her weight on
the corridor wall.  In the loft, Case groaned.  The second step
took her over an outstretched arm.  Uniform sleeve bright with
fresh blood.  Glimpse of a shattered fiberglass shockstave.  Her
vision seemed to have narrowed to a tunnel.  With the third
step, Case screamed and found himself back in the matrix.
`Brood?  Boston, baby...'  Her voice tight with pain.  She
coughed.  `Little problem with the natives.  Think one of them
broke my leg.'
`What you need now, Cat Mother?'  The link man's voice
was indistinct, nearly lost behind static.

Det. Sorrell: The kid was impaled with a baseball bat; I don't know how this James Earl guy could do it!

Case forced himself to flip back.  She was leaning against
the wall, taking all of her weight on her right leg.  She fumbled

a sheet of plastic studded with a rainbow of dermadisks.  She
selected three and thumbed them hard against her left wrist,
over the veins.  Six thousand micrograms of endorphin analog
came down on the pain like a hammer, shattering it.  Her back
arched convulsively.  Pink waves of warmth lapped up her thighs.
She sighed and slowly relaxed.
`Okay, Brood.  Okay now.  But I'll need a medical team

when I come out.  Tell my people.  Cutter, I'm two minutes
from target.  Can you hold?'

Servo: COME ON! 

`Tell her I'm in and holding,' Case said.
Molly began to limp down the corridor.  When she glanced
back, once, Case saw the crumpled bodies of three Sense/Net
security guards.  One of them seemed to have no eyes.
`Tacticals and Rapids have sealed the ground floor, Cat
Mother.  Foam barricades.  Lobby's getting juicy.'
`Pretty juicy down here,' she said, swinging herself through
a pair of gray steel doors.  `Almost there, Cutter.'
Case flipped into the matrix and pulled the trodes from his
forehead.  He was drenched with sweat.  He wiped his forehead
with a towel, took a quick sip of water from the bicycle bottle
beside the Hosaka, and checked the map of the library displayed
on the screen.  A pulsing red cursor crept through the outline
of a doorway.  Only millimeters from the green dot that indi-

cated the location of the Dixie Flatline's construct.  He won-
dered what it was doing to her leg, to walk on it that way.
With enough endorphin analog, she could walk on a pair of
bloody stumps.  He tightened the nylon harness that held him
in the chair and replaced the trodes.

Mike: Sorry, back in Da Nang there for a minute. 

Routine now: trodes, jack, and flip.
The Sense/Net research library was a dead storage area; the
materials stored here had to be physically removed before they
could be interfaced.  Molly hobbled between rows of identical
gray lockers.
`Tell her five more and ten to her left, Brood,' Case said.
`Five more and ten left, Cat Mother,' the link man said.
She took the left.  A white-faced librarian cowered between
two lockers, her cheeks wet, eyes blank.  Molly ignored her.
Case wondered what the Moderns had done to provoke that
level of terror.  He knew it had something to do with a hoaxed
threat, but he'd been too involved with his ice to follow Molly's
explanation.
`That's it,' Case said, but she'd already stopped in front of
the cabinet that held the construct.  Its lines reminded Case of
the Neo-Aztec bookcases in Julie Deane's anteroom in Chiba.
`Do it, Cutter,' Molly said.
Case flipped to cyberspace and sent a command pulsing
down the crimson thread that pierced the library ice.  Five sep-

themselves to have remained locked.  The library's central bank
suffered a minute shift in its permanent memory: the construct

Molly closed the locker door; Case flipped.

neatly with the Modern's terror run.  He doubted that the three
security men Molly had encountered in the corridor would live
to talk about it.  He flipped.
The elevator, with Molly's blackbox taped beside the control
panel, remained where she'd left it.  The guard still lay curled
on the floor.  Case noticed the derm on his neck for the first
time.  Something of Molly's, to keep him under.  She stepped
over him and removed the blackbox before punching LOBBY.
As the elevator door hissed open, a woman hurtled backward
out of the crowd, into the elevator, and struck the rear wall
with her head.  Molly ignored her, bending over to peel the
derm from the guard's neck.  Then she kicked the white pants

forehead.  The construct, in the suit's kangaroo pocket, dug
into her sternum when she moved.  She stepped out.

degree of efficiency.  Beyond the shattered wreckage of the

main street doors, bodies were piled three deep on the barri-
cades.  The hollow thumping of the riot guns provided a constant
background for the sound the crowd made as it surged back
and forth across the lobby's marble floor.  Case had never heard
anything like that sound.

Crow: That purse will be the death of him!  CrowRed roses for a blue ladyyyy...

Neither, apparently, had Molly.  `Jesus,' she said, and hes-

raw and total fear.  The lobby floor was covered with bodies,
clothing, blood, and long trampled scrolls of yellow printout.
`C'mon, sister.  We're for out.'  The eyes of the two Moderns
stared out of madly swirling shades of polycarbon, their suits
unable to keep up with the confusion of shape and color that

raged behind them.  `You hurt?  C'mon.  Tommy'll walk you.'
Tommy handed something to the one who spoke, a video cam-
era wrapped in polycarbon.
`Chicago,' she said, `I'm on my way.'  And then she was
falling, not to the marble floor, slick with blood and vomit,
but down some bloodwarm well, into silence and the dark.

The Panther Modern leader, who introduced himself as Lu-
pus Yonderboy, wore a polycarbon suit with a recording feature
that allowed him to replay backgrounds at will.  Perched on the
edge of Case's worktable like some kind of state of the art
gargoyle, he regarded Case and Armitage with hooded eyes.
He smiled.  His hair was pink.  A rainbow forest of microsofts
bristled behind his left ear; the ear was pointed, tufted with
more pink hair.  His pupils had been modified to catch the light

`Pay him,' Case said.
Armitage glared at him.  `We don't have the goods.'

Crow: So deep, we should've been wearing boots.

`Your woman has it,' Yonderboy said.
`Pay him.'

The phone rang.  Case answered.
`Molly,' he told Armitage, handing him the phone.

Paul: Well, it's his Indian name. His tribal one.


The Sprawl's geodesics were lightening into predawn gray
as Case left the building.  His limbs felt cold and disconnected.

Daphne: Everybody have sex tonight!

He couldn't sleep.  He was sick of the loft.  Lupus had gone,
then Armitage, and Molly was in surgery somewhere.  Vibration
beneath his feet as a train hissed past.  Sirens dopplered in the
distance.

the faces of the three people he'd killed in Chiba.  The men
were blanks; the woman reminded him of Linda Lee.  A battered
tricycle-truck with mirrored windows bounced past him, empty
plastic cylinders rattling in its bed.

Mike: ...So we're watching someone waiting for someone.

`Case.'
He darted sideways, instinctively getting a wall behind his
back.
`Message for you, Case.'  Lupus Yonderboy's suit cycled
through pure primaries.  `Pardon.  Not to startle you.'
Case straightened up, hands in jacket pockets.  He was a
head taller than the Modern.  `You oughta be careful, Yon-
derboy.'
`This is the message.  Wintermute.'  He spelled it out.
`From you?'  Case took a step forward.

Frank: You lost the last of the wild horses, you dink! 

`No,' Yonderboy said.  `For you.'
`Who from?'
`Wintermute,' Yonderboy repeated, nodding, bobbing his
crest of pink hair.  His suit went matte black, a carbon shadow
against old concrete.  He executed a strange little dance, his
thin black arms whirling, and then he was gone.  No.  There.
Hood up to hide the pink, the suit exactly the right shade of
gray, mottled and stained as the sidewalk he stood on.  The
eyes winked back the red of a stoplight.  And then he was really
gone.

McAlister: The dark times have gone.

Case closed his eyes, massaged them with numb fingers,
leaning back against peeling brickwork.
Ninsei had been a lot simpler.

The medical team Molly employed occupied two floors of
an anonymous condo-rack near the old hub of Baltimore.  The
building was modular, like some giant version of Cheap Hotel,
each coffin forty meters long.  Case met Molly as she emerged
from one that wore the elaborately worked logo of one GER-
ALD CHIN, DENTIST.  She was limping.

Servo: Except Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister, Grandpa, Grandma...

`I ran into one of your pals,' he said, `a Modern.'

napkin with W I N T E R M U T E printed in red feltpen in
his neat, laborious capitals.  `He said --'  But her hand came
up in the jive for silence.

Loring: How many weeks is she?

`Get us some crab,' she said.

After lunch in Baltimore, Molly dissecting her crab with
alarming ease, they tubed in to New York.  Case had learned
not to ask questions; they only brought the sign for silence.
Her leg seemed to be bothering her, and she seldom spoke.
A thin black child with wooden beads and antique resistors
woven tightly into her hair opened the Finn's door and led them
along the tunnel of refuse.  Case felt the stuff had grown some-
how during their absence.  Or else it seemed that it was changing
subtly, cooking itself down under the pressure of time, silent
invisible flakes settling to form a mulch, a crystalline essence
of discarded technology, flowering secretly in the Sprawl's
waste places.
Beyond the army blanket, the Finn waited at the white table.
Molly began to sign rapidly, produced a scrap of paper,
wrote something on it, and passed it to the Finn.  He took it
between thumb and forefinger, holding it away from his body

Crow: Don't hit him...

tered tweed jacket.  A glass jar of pickled herring stood on the
table beside a torn plastic package of flatbread and a tin ashtray
piled with the butts of Partagas.
`Wait,' the Finn said, and left the room.
Molly took his place, extruded the blade from her index

finger, and speared a grayish slab of herring.  Case wandered
aimlessly around the room, fingering the scanning gear on the
pylons as he passed.
Ten minutes and the Finn came bustling back, showing his
teeth in a wide yellow smile.  He nodded, gave Molly a thumbs-
up salute, and gestured to Case to help him with the door panel.
While Case smoothed the velcro border into place, the Finn
took a flat little console from his pocket and punched out an
elaborate sequence.
`Honey,' he said to Molly, tucking the console away, `you

`Yonderboy,' Molly said, shoving the herring and crackers
aside.  `I did a deal with Larry, on the side.'
`Smart,' the Finn said.  `It's an AI.'
`Slow it down a little,' Case said.

`What's in Berne, okay?'  Case deliberately stepped between
them.
`Wintermute is the recognition code for an AI.  I've got the
Turing Registry numbers.  Artificial intelligence.'
`That's all just fine,' Molly said, `but where's it get us?'
`If Yonderboy's right,' the Finn said, `this AI is backing

`I paid Larry to have the Moderns nose around Armitage a

`And you think it's this AI?  Those things aren't allowed
any autonomy.  It'll be the parent corporation, this Tessle...'

Joel: No, no, it's a feeling I have. My gut instincts tell me that this is gonna hurt real bad.

`Tessier-Ashpool S.A.,' said the Finn.  `And I got a little
story for you about them.  Wanna hear?'  He sat down and
hunched forward.
`Finn,' Molly said.  `He loves a story.'
`Haven't ever told anybody this one,' the Finn began.


Joel: Let's go.

traditional articles of the trade.  In precious metals, stamps, rare
coins, gems, jewelry, furs, and paintings and other works of
art.  The story he told Case and Molly began with another man's
story, a man he called Smith.

formidable, at least by the standards of his colleagues.  But

his pocket microscope and advised Jimmy to melt the thing
down.  It was contemporary, not an antique, and had no value
to the collector.  Jimmy laughed.  The thing was a computer
terminal, he said.  It could talk.  And not in a synth-voice, but
with a beautiful arrangement of gears and miniature organ pipes.
It was a baroque thing for anyone to have constructed, a per-
verse thing, because synth-voice chips cost next to nothing.  It
was a curiosity.  Smith jacked the head into his computer and
listened as the melodious, inhuman voice piped the figures of

Smith's clientele included a Tokyo billionaire whose passion
for clockwork automata approached fetishism.  Smith shrugged,

for it.

Crow: There's a mailing address for Macchu Pichu.

When Jimmy had gone, leaving the head, Smith went over
it carefully, discovering certain hallmarks.  Eventually he'd been
able to trace it to an unlikely collaboration between two Zurich
artisans, an enamel specialist in Paris, a Dutch jeweler, and a
California chip designer.  It had been commissioned, he dis-
covered, by Tessier-Ashpool S.A.
Smith began to make preliminary passes at the Tokyo col-
lector, hinting that he was on the track of something notewor-
thy.
And then he had a visitor, a visitor unannounced, one who
walked in through the elaborate maze of Smith's security as
though it didn't exist.  A small man, Japanese, enormously
polite, who bore all the marks of a vatgrown ninja assassin.
Smith sat very still, staring into the calm brown eyes of death

across a polished table of Vietnamese rosewood.  Gently, almost
apologetically, the cloned killer explained that it was his duty
to find and return a certain artwork, a mechanism of great
beauty, which had been taken from the house of his master.  It
had come to his attention, the ninja said, that Smith might
know of the whereabouts of this object.
Smith told the man that he had no wish to die, and produced
the head.  And how much, his visitor asked, did you expect to
obtain through the sale of this object?  Smith named a figure
far lower than the price he'd intended to set.  The ninja produced

a credit chip and keyed Smith that amount out of a numbered
Swiss account.  And who, the man asked, brought you this
piece?  Smith told him.  Within days, Smith learned of Jimmy's
death.

Servo: Ooh, good one, "Death Spank"!

knew I dealt a lot with the Memory Lane crowd, and that's

Case raised his eyebrows.

`Crack it.'  She laughed.  `Earn your keep for a change.'

Case waited for a trans-BAMA local on the crowded plat-
form.  Molly had gone back to the loft hours ago, the Flatline's

ever since.
It was disturbing to think of the Flatline as a construct, a

watched the other passengers as he rode.  A pair of predatory-
looking Christian Scientists were edging toward a trio of young

wrists, wet pink glittering under the harsh lighting.  The techs

like polished hooves against the gray metal of the car's floor.
Before they could stampede, take flight from the missionaries,
the train reached Case's station.
He stepped out and caught sight of a white holographic cigar
suspended against the wall of the station, FREESIDE pulsing
beneath it in contorted capitals that mimicked printed Japanese.
He walked through the crowd and stood beneath it, studying
the thing.  WHY WAIT? pulsed the sign.  A blunt white spindle,
flanged and studded with grids and radiators, docks, domes.
He'd seen the ad, or others like it, thousands of times.  It had
never appealed to him.  With his deck, he could reach the
Freeside banks as easily as he could reach Atlanta.  Travel was
a meat thing.  But now he noticed the little sigil, the size of a

small coin, woven into the lower left corner of the ad's fabric
of light: T-A.
He walked back to the loft, lost in memories of the Flatline.
He'd spent most of his nineteenth summer in the Gentleman
Loser, nursing expensive beers and watching the cowboys.
He'd never touched a deck, then, but he knew what he wanted.
There were at least twenty other hopefuls ghosting the Loser,
that summer, each one bent on working joeboy for some cow-
boy.  No other way to learn.
They'd all heard of Pauley, the redneck jockey from the
'Lanta fringes, who'd survived braindeath behind black ice.
The grapevine -- slender, street level, and the only one going --
had little to say about Pauley, other than that he'd done the
impossible.  `It was big,' another would-be told Case, for the
price of a beer, `but who knows what?  I hear maybe a Brazilian
payroll net.  Anyway, the man was dead, flat down braindeath.'
Case stared across the crowded bar at a thickset man in shirt-
sleeves, something leaden about the shade of his skin.
`Boy,' the Flatline would tell him, months later in Miami,
`I'm like them huge fuckin'~ lizards, you know?  Had themself

The cowboy elite in the Loser shunned Pauley out of some
strange group anxiety, almost a superstition.  McCoy Pauley,

Molly was snoring on the temperfoam.  A transparent cast

skin beneath the rigid micropore mottled with bruises, the black
shading into ugly yellow.  Eight derms, each a different size
and color, ran in a neat line down her left wrist.  An Akai

transdermal unit lay beside her, its fine red leads connected to
input trodes under the cast.
He turned on the tensor beside the Hosaka.  The crisp circle
of light fell directly on the Flatline's construct.  He slotted some
ice, connected the construct, and jacked in.
It was exactly the sensation of someone reading over his
shoulder.
He coughed.  `Dix?  McCoy?  That you man?'  His throat was
tight.
`Hey, bro,' said a directionless voice.

Crow: There's a deeeaaaaad hunk in the middle of the road! Dead boy! 

`It's Case, man.  Remember?'

Tom: Yeah, after Slim-Fast! 

`Miami, joeboy, quick study.'
`What's the last thing you remember before I spoke to you,

Crow: Uh, that's Womanschool? 

`Nothin'~.'
`Hang on.'  He disconnected the construct.  The presence
was gone.  He reconnected it.  `Dix?  Who am I?'

Mike: But my will won't!

`Ca -- your buddy.  Partner.  What's happening, man?'

`No.'
`Know how a ROM personality matrix works?'
`Sure, bro, it's a firmware construct.'
`So I jack it into the bank I'm using, I can give it sequential,

`Guess so,' said the construct.
`Okay, Dix.  You _are_ a ROM construct.  Got me?'
`If you say so,' said the construct.  `Who are you?'
`Case.'

`Right.  And for starts, Dix, you and me, we're gonna sleaze

trying to catch the pauses the construct used to indicate timing.
It took three tries.
`Big deal,' said the Flatline.  `No ice at all.'

the temperfoam mold itself against him.

various parts of a story about a man called Corto.  The Hosaka
had sorted a thin store of data and assembled a precis, but it
was full of gaps.  Some of the material had been print records,

Mike: Washingtonland, the new Disney theme park! 

The Hosaka rattled through police reports, corporate espi-
onage records, and news files.  Case watched Corto work cor-
porate defectors in Lisbon and Marrakesh, where he seemed
to grow obsessed with the idea of betrayal, to loathe the sci-
entists and technicians he bought out for his employers.  Drunk,

interrogation, everything had gone gray.
Translated French medical records explained that a man
without identification had been taken to a Paris mental health
unit and diagnosed as schizophrenic.  He became catatonic and
was sent to a government institution on the outskirts of Toulon.
He became a subject in an experimental program that sought
to reverse schizophrenia through the application of cybernetic
models.  A random selection of patients were provided with
microcomputers and encouraged, with help from students, to
program them.  He was cured, the only success in the entire
experiment.

Watney: Cabot, will you listen to me? I wanna go home right now, Cabot. Where are you going? No, no, wait there, Cabot! Tell me what the hell's going on, here. Is this one of your crazy science experiments, huh?

The record ended there.
Case turned on the foam and Molly cursed him softly for
disturbing her.

The telephone rang.  He pulled it into bed.  `Yeah?'
`We're going to Istanbul,' Armitage said.  `Tonight.'

Servo: Yeah, well, you look like Howdy Doody with a headcold.

`What does the bastard want?' Molly asked.
`Says we're going to Istanbul tonight.'
`That's just wonderful.'
Armitage was reading off flight numbers and departure times.
Molly sat up and turned on the light.
`What about my gear?' Case asked.  `My deck.'
`Finn will handle it,' said Armitage, and hung up.
Case watched her pack.  There were dark circles under her
eyes, but even with the cast on, it was like watching a dance.
No wasted motion.  His clothes were a rumpled pile beside his
bag.
`You hurting?' he asked.
`I could do with another night at Chin's.'

`You ever been to 'Stambul?'
`Couple days, once.'
`Never changes,' she said.  `Bad old town.'

`It was like this when we headed for Chiba,' Molly said,
staring out the train window at blasted industrial moonscape,
red beacons on the horizon warning aircraft away from a fusion
plant.  `We were in L.A.  He came in and said Pack, we were
booked for Macau.  When we got there, I played fantan in the

from the sleeve of her black jacket and polished the insets.  The
landscape of the northern Sprawl woke confused memories of
childhood for Case, dead grass tufting the cracks in a canted
slab of freeway concrete.
The train began to decelerate ten kilometers from the airport.
Case watched the sun rise on the landscape of childhood, on

Mike: Yes you are, look—look, I'm sorry. It was a good joke...

It was raining in Beyoglu, and the rented Mercedes slid past
the grilled and unlit windows of cautious Greek and Armenian
jewelers.  The street was almost empty, only a few dark-coated
figures on the sidewalks turning to stare after the car.
`This was formerly the prosperous European section of Ot-
toman Istanbul,' purred the Mercedes.

Servo: It's Thomas Edison, with his electric child! 

`So it's gone downhill,' Case said.
`The Hilton's in Cumhuriyet Caddesi,' Molly said.  She
settled back against the car's gray ultrasuede.
`How come Armitage flies alone?' Case asked.  He had a
headache.
`'Cause you get up his nose.  You're sure getting up mine.'
He wanted to tell her the Corto story, but decided against
it.  He'd used a sleep derm, on the plane.
The road in from the airport had been dead straight, like a

The Finn, in a new Shinjuku suit, sarariman black, was
waiting sourly in the Hilton lobby, marooned on a velour arm-
chair in a sea of pale blue carpeting.
`Christ,' Molly said.  `Rat in a business suit.'
They crossed the lobby.
`How much you get paid to come over here, Finn?'  She
lowered her bag beside the armchair.  `Bet not as much as you
get for wearing that suit, huh?'
The Finn's upper lips drew back.  `Not enough, sweetmeat.'
He handed her a magnetic key with a round yellow tag.  `You're
registered already.  Honcho's upstairs.'  He looked around.  `This
town sucks.'

Exeter: I'm afraid I don't know the gent—

`You get agoraphobic, they take you out from under a dome.

`I gotta check out some guy's implants,' the Finn said.
`How about my deck?' Case asked.
The Finn winced.  `Observe the protocol.  Ask the boss.'

taken refuge in doorways, their old voiceprinters wrapped in
sheets of clear plastic, evidence that the written word still
enjoyed a certain prestige here.  It was a sluggish country.  He

He had the phone in his hand before it had a chance to ring
twice.  `Glad you're up,' Armitage said.
`I'm just.  Lady's still under.  Listen, boss, I think it's maybe
time we have a little talk.  I think I work better if I know a
little more about what I'm doing.'
Silence on the line.  Case bit his lip.

Mike: I said sir, yes sir!

`You know as much as you need to.  Maybe more.'
`You think so?'
`Get dressed, Case.  Get her up.  You'll have a caller in
about fifteen minutes.  His name is Terzibashjian.'  The phone
bleated softly.  Armitage was gone.
`Wake up, baby,' Case said.  `Biz.'

Hargrove: Make it a double, will you?

`I've been awake an hour already.'  The mirrors turned.
`We got a Jersey Bastion coming up.'

Crow: Oh. When did they change the name?

`You got an ear for language, Case.  Bet you're part Ar-
menian.  That's the eye Armitage has had on Riviera.  Help me
up.'

Servo: That means you're a sexual predator. 

Terzibashjian proved to be a young man in a gray suit and
gold-framed, mirrored glasses.  His white shirt was open at the
collar, revealing a mat of dark hair so dense that Case at first
mistook it for some kind of t-shirt.  He arrived with a black

Hilton tray arranged with three tiny, fragrant cups of thick
black coffee and three sticky, straw-colored Oriental sweets.
`We must, as you say in _Ingiliz,_ take this one very easy.'
He seemed to stare pointedly at Molly, but at last he removed
the silver glasses.  His eyes were a dark brown that matched
the shade of his very short military-cut hair.  He smiled.  `It is

She extended the gun.  `Maybe you get the explosives, lots

Terzibashjian nodded.  `Worst is how you say in _Ingiliz,_ the

`On our left,' said the Mercedes, as it steered through a
maze of rainy streets, `is Kapali Carsi, the grand bazaar.'
Beside Case, the Finn made an appreciative noise, but he
was looking in the wrong direction.  The right side of the street

was lined with miniature scrapyards.  Case saw a gutted loco-
motive atop rust-stained, broken lengths of fluted marble.
Headless marble statues were stacked like firewood.
`Homesick?' Case asked.

Crow: This is where my tongue lives. 

`Place sucks,' the Finn said.  His black silk tie was starting
to resemble a worn carbon ribbon.  There were medallions of
kebab gravy and fried egg on the lapels of the new suit.
`Hey, Jersey,' Case said to the Armenian, who sat behind
them, `where'd this guy get his stuff installed?'
`In Chiba City.  He has no left lung.  The other is boosted,
is how you say it?  Anyone might buy these implants, but this
one is most talented.'  The Mercedes swerved avoiding a bal-
loon-tired dray stacked with hides.  `I have followed him in the
street and seen a dozen cycles fall, near him, in a day.  Find

`That's okay,' Case said.  `Means shut up.'

The transceiver answered in French.  The Mercedes swung
smoothly around a corner.  `The spice bazaar, sometimes called

Mike: It's all freeways now.

`A mixture of cocaine and meperidine, yes.'  The Armenian
went back to the conversation he was having with the Sanyo.

`Demerol they used to call that,' said the Finn.  `He's a

`Never mind,' Case said, turning up the collar of his jacket,
`we'll get the poor fucker a new pancreas or something.'

Once they entered the bazaar, the Finn brightened notice-
ably, as though he were comforted by the crowd density and
the sense of enclosure.  They walked with the Armenian along
a broad concourse, beneath soot-stained sheets of plastic and
green-painted ironwork out of the age of steam.  A thousand
suspended ads writhed and flickered.
`Hey, Christ,' the Finn said, taking Case's arm, `looka
that.'  He pointed.  `It's a horse, man.  You ever see a horse?'
Case glanced at the embalmed animal and shook his head.

Servo: Two roads diverged into a yellow wood / And, sorry I could not take my hog down both / And be one traveller, long I stood.

It was displayed on a sort of pedestal, near the entrance to a
place that sold birds and monkeys.  The thing's legs had been
worn black and hairless by decades of passing hands.  `Saw

three years after the pandemic.  There's Arabs still trying to
code 'em up from the DNA, but they always croak.'
The animal's brown glass eyes seemed to follow them as
they passed.  Terzibashjian led them into a cafe near the core
of the market, a low-ceilinged room that looked as though it
had been in continuous operation for centuries.  Skinny boys
in soiled white coats dodged between the crowded tables, bal-
ancing steel trays with bottles of Turk-Tuborg and tiny glasses
of tea.

Servo: Huh. What do you think he's a son of? Son of a preacher man? Son of a son of a sailor, maybe?

Case bought a pack of Yeheyuans from a vendor by the
door.  The Armenian was muttering to his Sanyo.  `Come,' he
said, `he is moving.  Each night he rides the _tunel_ to the bazaar
to purchase his mixture from Ali.  Your woman is close.  Come.'

The alley was an old place, too old, the walls cut from

Crow: Puma Man! He flies like a moron! 

blocks of dark stone.  The pavement was uneven and smelled
of a century's dripping gasoline, absorbed by ancient limestone.

Servo: Let us the nasty do. 

`Can't see shit,' he whispered to the Finn.  `That's okay for
sweetmeat,' the Finn said.  `Quiet,' said Terzibashjian, too
loudly.

A figure stepped out and the door grated shut again, leaving
the narrow place in darkness.  Case shivered.

Servo: Boy! Defending my misogyny really takes commitment! 

`Now,' Terzibashjian said, and a brilliant beam of white
light, directed from the rooftop of the building opposite the
market, pinned the slender figure beside the ancient wooden
door in a perfect circle.  Bright eyes darted left, right, and the
man crumpled.  Case thought someone had shot him; he lay

rope-tendoned arms flexed grayish-pink in the glare.  The thing
seemed to pull itself up out of the pavement, through the inert,
bloody ruin that had been Riviera.  It was two meters tall, stood
on two legs, and seemed to be headless.  Then it swung slowly
to face them, and Case saw that it had a head, but no neck.  It

was eyeless, the skin gleaming a wet intestinal pink.  The mouth,
if it was a mouth, was circular, conical, shallow, and lined
with a seething growth of hairs or bristles, glittering like black
chrome.  It kicked the rags of clothing and flesh aside and took
a step, the mouth seeming to scan for them as it moved.
Terzibashjian said something in Greek or Turkish and rushed
the thing, his arms spread like a man attempting to dive through
a window.  He went through it.  Into the muzzle-flash of a pistol
from the dark beyond the circle of light.  Fragments of rock
whizzed past Case's head; the Finn jerked him down into a
crouch.
The light from the rooftop vanished, leaving him with mis-
matched afterimages of muzzle-flash, monster, and white beam.
His ears rang.
Then the light returned, bobbing now, searching the shad-
ows.  Terzibashjian was leaning against a steel door, his face
very white in the glare.  He held his left wrist and watched
blood drip from a wound in his left hand.  The blond man,
whole again, unbloodied, lay at his feet.
Molly stepped out of the shadows, all in black, with her

she said.  `Nice gun.'
Terzibashjian made a whining sound.  Case saw that most
of his middle finger was missing.

Narrator: She was the kind of girl who'd be happy just being "Mrs. Joe".



Narrator: Jean and Louise were leaving for their jobs in the city, so you all drove down to the train station to see them all.

With the city drenched in predawn blue, she told the Mercedes
to take them to Topkapi.  The Finn and an enormous Turk named
Mahmut had taken Riviera, still unconscious, from the alley.
Minutes later, a dusty Citroen had arrived for the Armenian,
who seemed on the verge of fainting.
`You're an asshole,' Molly told the man, opening the ear
door for him.  `You shoulda hung back.  I had him in my sights
as soon as he stepped out.'  Terzibashjian glared at her.  `So
we're through with you anyway.'  She shoved him in and
slammed the door.  `Run into you again and I'll kill you,' she
said to the white face behind the tinted window.  The Citroen
ground away down the alley and swung clumsily into the street.
Now the Mercedes whispered through Istanbul as the city
woke.  They passed the Beyoglu _tunel_ terminal and sped past
mazes of deserted back streets, run-down apartment houses that

reminded Case vaguely of Paris.
`What is this thing?' he asked Molly, as the Mercedes
parked itself on the fringes of the gardens that surround the
Seraglio.  He stared dully at the baroque conglomeration of
styles that was Topkapi.
`It was sort of a private whorehouse for the King,' she said,
getting out stretching.  `Kept a lotta women there.  Now it's a
museum.  Kinda like Finn's shop, all this stuff just jumbled in
there, big diamonds, swords, the left hand of John the
Baptist...'
`Like in a support vat?'
`Nah.  Dead.  Got it inside this brass hand thing, little hatch
on the side so the Christians could kiss it for luck.  Got it off
the Christians about a million years ago, and they never dust

the goddam thing, 'cause it's an infidel relic.'
Black iron deer rusted in the gardens of the Seraglio.  Case
walked beside her, watching the toes of her boots crunch unkept
grass made stiff by an early frost.  They walked beside a path
of cold octagonal flagstones.  Winter was waiting, somewhere
in the Balkans.
`That Terzi, he's grade-A scum,' she said.  `He's the secret
police.  Torturer.  Real easy to buy out, too, with the kind of
money Armitage was offering.'  In the wet trees around them,
birds began to sing.
`I did that job for you,' Case said, `the one in London I
got something, but I don't know what it means.'  He told her

the Corto story.
`Well, I knew there wasn't anybody name of Armitage in
that Screaming Fist.  Looked it up.'  She stroked the rusted
flank of an iron doe.  `You figure the little computer pulled
him out of it?  In that French hospital?'
`I figure Wintermute,' Case said.
She nodded.
`Thing is,' he said, `do you think he knows he was Corto,
before?  I mean, he wasn't anybody in particular, by the time
he hit the ward, so maybe Wintermute just...'
`Yeah.  Built him up from go.  Yeah...'  She turned and
they walked on.  `It figures.  You know, the guy doesn't have
any life going, in private.  Not as far as I can tell.  You see a
guy like that, you figure there's something he does when he's
alone.  But not Armitage.  Sits and stares at the wall, man.  Then
something clicks and he goes into high gear and wheels for
Wintermute.'
`So why's he got that stash in London?  Nostalgia?'

Servo: I'LL TAKE HER, I'LL TAKE HER!! 

`Maybe he doesn't know about it,' she said.  `Maybe it's
just in his name, right?'
`I don't get it,' Case said.

Joel: A preteen is put to work. Her beauty will soon fade.

`Just thinking out loud...  How smart's an AI, Case?'

Servo: Well, what do you expect, he's only a child! 

`Depends.  Some aren't much smarter than dogs.  Pets.  Cost
a fortune anyway.  The real smart ones are as smart as the
Turing heat is willing to let 'em get.'
`Look, you're a cowboy.  How come you aren't just flat-
out fascinated with those things?'
`Well,' he said, `for starts, they're rare.  Most of them are
military, the bright ones, and we can't crack the ice.  That's

where ice all comes from, you know?  And then there's the
Turing cops, and that's bad heat.'  He looked at her.  `I dunno,
it just isn't part of the trip.'
`Jockeys all the same,' she said.  `No imagination.'
They came to a broad rectangular pond where carp nuzzled
the stems of some white aquatic flower.  She kicked a loose
pebble in and watched the ripples spread.
`That's Wintermute,' she said.  `This deal's real big, looks
to me.  We're out where the little waves are too broad, we can't
see the rock that hit the center.  We know something's there,
but not why.  I wanna know why.  I want you to go and talk to
Wintermute.'
`I couldn't get near it,' he said.  `You're dreaming.'
`Try.'
`Can't be done.'
`Ask the Flatline.'
`What do we want out of that Riviera?' he asked, hoping

Doc: My left or my right?

to change the subject.
She spat into the pond.  `God knows.  I'd as soon kill him
as look at him.  I saw his profile.  He's a kind of compulsive

sure she turned political.  He's got a personality like a Modern's
suit.  The profile said it was a very rare type, estimated one in
a couple of million.  Which anyway says something good about
human nature, I guess.'  She stared at the white flowers and
the sluggish fish, her face sour.  `I think I'm going to have to
buy myself some special insurance on that Peter.'  Then she
turned and smiled, and it was very cold.
`What's that mean?'
`Never mind.  Let's go back to Beyoglu and find something
like breakfast.  I gotta busy night again, tonight.  Gotta collect
his stuff from that apartment in Fener, gotta go back to the
bazaar and buy him some drugs...'
`Buy him some drugs?  How's he rate?'
She laughed.  `He's not dying on the wire, sweetheart.  And
it looks like he can't work without that special taste.  I like you
better now, anyway, you aren't so goddam skinny.'  She smiled.
`So I'll go to Ali the dealer and stock up.  You betcha.'


Servo: Which means I really, really hate the citizens and officials of Rutland, Vermont. I'm not kidding, Mike. I never liked the citizens and officials of stupid Rutland, Vermont! This is just the nail in the coffin, as far as I'm concerned. Go to hell, citizens and officials of Rutland, Vermont!

Armitage was waiting in their room at the Hilton.
`Time to pack,' he said, and Case tried to find the man
called Corto behind the pale blue eyes and the tanned mask.
He thought of Wage, back in Chiba.  Operators above a certain
level tended to submerge their personalities, he knew.  But
Wage had had vices, lovers.  Even, it had been rumored, chil-
dren.  The blankness he found in Armitage was something else.
`Where to now?' he asked, walking past the man to stare

down into the street.  `What kind of climate?'
`They don't have climate, just weather,' Armitage said.
`Here.  Read the brochure.'  He put something on the coffee
table and stood.
`Did Riviera check out okay?  Where's the Finn?'
`Riviera's fine.  The Finn is on his way home.'  Armitage
smiled, a smile that meant as much as the twitch of some
insect's antenna.  His gold bracelet clinked as he reached out
to prod Case in the chest.  `Don't get too smart.  Those little

sacs are starting to show wear, but you don't know how much.'
Case kept his face very still and forced himself to nod.
When Armitage was gone, he picked up one of the bro-
chures.  It was expensively printed, in French, English, and
Turkish.
FREESIDE -- WHY WAIT?

Mike: Doughnuts?


The four of them were booked on a _THY_ flight out of Yes-
ilky airport.  Transfer at Paris to the _JAL_ shuttle.  Case sat in
the lobby of the Istanbul Hilton and watched Riviera browse
bogus Byzantine fragments in the glass-walled gift shop.  Ar-
mitage, his trenchcoat draped over his shoulders like a cape,
stood in the shop's entrance.

Crow: Let's chip in and buy this movie a life. 

Riviera was slender, blond, soft-voiced, his English ac-
centless and fluid.  Molly said he was thirty, but it would have

stateless and traveled under a forged Dutch passport.  He was
a product of the rubble rings that fringe the radioactive core
of old Bonn.

shop too quickly, too obviously, to stand beside Riviera.  Ri-
viera turned and smiled.  He was very beautiful; Case assumed
the features were the work of a Chiba surgeon.  A subtle job,
nothing like Armitage's blandly handsome blend of pop faces.
The man's forehead was high and smooth, gray eyes calm and
distant.  His nose, which might have been too nicely sculpted,
seemed to have been broken and clumsily reset.  The suggestion
of brutality offset the delicacy of his jaw and the quickness of
his smile.  His teeth were small, even, and very white.  Case
watched the white hands play over the imitation fragments of
sculpture.
Riviera didn't act like a man who'd been attacked the night
before, drugged with a toxin-flechette, abducted, subjected to
the Finn's examination, and pressured by Armitage into joining

Case checked his watch.  Molly was due back from her drug

run.  He looked up at Riviera again.  `I bet you're stoned right
now, asshole,' he said to the Hilton lobby.  A graying Italian
matron in a white leather tuxedo jacket lowered her Porsche
glasses to stare at him.  He smiled broadly, stood, and shoul-
dered his bag.  He needed cigarettes for the flight.  He wondered
if there was a smoking section on the _JAL_ shuttle.  `See ya,
lady,' he said to the woman, who promptly slid the sunglasses
back up her nose and turned away.
There were cigarettes in the gift shop, but he didn't relish
talking with Armitage or Riviera.  He left the lobby and located
a vending console in a narrow alcove, at the end of a rank of
pay phones.

Mike: So, one clod says one thing and the whole world pays???

He fumbled through a pocketful of lirasi, slotting the small
dull alloy coins one after another, vaguely amused by the anach-

ronism of the process.  The phone nearest him rang.
Automatically, he picked it up.

Servo: He runs around screaming!

`Yeah?'

Narrator: And so... the end of a perfect day.

Faint harmonics, tiny inaudible voices rattling across some
orbital link, and then a sound like wind.
`Hello, Case.'

The Meredith Monk Story: A One-Woman Show!

A fifty-lirasi coin fell from his hand, bounced, and rolled
out of sight across Hilton carpeting.
`Wintermute, Case.  It's time we talk.'
It was a chip voice.
`Don't you want to talk, Case?'
He hung up.

Mike: Hey Crow, c'mon...

On his way back to the lobby, his cigarettes forgotten, he
had to walk the length of the ranked phones.  Each rang in turn,
but only once, as he passed.

Case saw the jewel-glow of a Greek island town.  And once,
reaching for his drink, he caught the flicker of a thing like a
giant human sperm in the depths of his bourbon and water.
Molly leaned across him and slapped Riviera's face, once.

Servo: Ah, how many times Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie had sex! 

`No, baby.  No games.  You play that subliminal shit around
me, I'll hurt you real bad.  I can do it without damaging you

smooth face was calm, the blue eyes alert, but there was no
anger.  `That's right, Peter.  Don't.'
Case turned back, in time to catch the briefest flash of a
black rose, its petals sheened like leather, the black stem thorned
with bright chrome.
Peter Riviera smiled sweetly, closed his eyes, and fell in-
stantly asleep.
Molly turned away, her lenses reflected in the dark window.

shuttle.
`Nah.  Never travel much, just for biz.'  The steward was
attaching readout trodes to his wrist and left ear.
`Hope you don't get SAS,' she said.

Crow: Y'know, ironically, they were only able to bust the zombie for tax evasion! 

`Airsick?  No way.'

set of trodes from his red plastic apron.
Case turned his head and tried to make out the outline of
the old Orly terminals, but the shuttle pad was screened by
graceful blast-deflectors of wet concrete.  The one nearest the

He closed his eyes and told himself the shuttle was only a
big airplane, one that flew very high.  It smelled like an airplane,
like new clothes and chewing gum and exhaustion.  He listened
to the piped koto music and waited.
Twenty minutes, then gravity came down on him like a
great soft hand with bones of ancient stone.

Space adaptation syndrome was worse than Molly's de-
scription, but it passed quickly enough and he was able to
sleep.  The steward woke him as they were preparing to dock
at _JAL_'s terminal cluster.
`We transfer to Freeside now?' he asked, eyeing a shred
of Yeheyuan tobacco that had drifted gracefully up out of his
shirt pocket to dance ten centimeters from his nose.  There was
no smoking on shuttle flights.
`No, we got the boss's usual little kink in the plans, you

touched the release plate on her harness and began to free
herself from the embrace of the foam.  `Funny choice of venue,
you ask me.'
`How's that?'
`Dreads.  Rastas.  Colony's about thirty years old now.'
`What's that mean?'
`You'll see.  It's an okay place by me.  Anyway, they'll let

Zion had been founded by five workers who'd refused to
return, who'd turned their backs on the well and started build-

ing.  They'd suffered calcium loss and heart shrinkage before
rotational gravity was established in the colony's central torus.
Seen from the bubble of the taxi, Zion's makeshift hull re-
minded Case of the patchwork tenements of Istanbul, the ir-
regular, discolored plates laser-scrawled with Rastafarian
symbols and the initials of welders.

Mike: You said you knew where the chase was!

Molly and a skinny Zionite called Aerol helped Case ne-
gotiate a freefall corridor into the core of a smaller torus.  He'd
lost track of Armitage and Riviera in the wake of a second
wave of SAS vertigo.  `Here,' Molly said, shoving his legs
into a narrow hatchway overhead.  `Grab the rungs.  Make like

Secretary General: God be with you.

that's like you're climbing down into gravity.  Got it?'
Case's stomach churned.
`You be fine, mon,' Aerol said, his grin bracketed with
gold incisors.
Somehow, the end of the tunnel had become its bottom.
Case embraced the weak gravity like a drowning man finding
a pocket of air.
`Up,' Molly said, `you gonna kiss it next?'  Case lay flat
on the deck, on his stomach, arms spread.  Something struck
him on the shoulder.  He rolled over and saw a fat bundle of
elastic cable.  `Gotta play house,' she said.  `You help me string
this up.'  He looked around the wide, featureless space and
noticed steel rings welded on every surface, seemingly at ran-

dom.

Servo: Most of us are morally ambiguous, which explains our random dying patterns. 

When they'd strung the cables, according to some complex
scheme of Molly's, they hung them with battered sheets of
yellow plastic.  As they worked, Case gradually became aware
of the music that pulsed constantly through the cluster.  It was
called dub, a sensuous mosaic cooked from vast libraries of
digitalized pop; it was worship, Molly said, and a sense of
community.  Case heaved at one of the yellow sheets; the thing
was light but still awkward.  Zion smelled of cooked vegetables,
humanity, and ganja.
`Good,' Armitage said, gliding loose-kneed through the
hatch and nodding at the maze of sheets.  Riviera followed, less
certain in the partial gravity.
`Where were you when it needed doing?' Case asked Ri-

viera.


The man opened his mouth to speak.  A small trout swam
out, trailing impossible bubbles.  It glided past Case's cheek.
`In the head,' Riviera said, and smiled.
Case laughed.
`Good,' Riviera said, `you can laugh.  I would have tried
to help you, but I'm no good with my hands.'  He held up his
palms, which suddenly doubled.  Four arms, four hands.

Servo: And a shower, and a job.

`Just the harmless clown, right, Riviera?'  Molly stepped

between them.
`Yo,' Aerol said, from the hatch, `you wan'~ come wi'~ me,

`It's your deck,' Armitage said, `and the other gear.  Help

`You ver'~ pale, mon,' Aerol said, as they were guiding the
foam-bundled Hosaka terminal along the central corridor.
`Maybe you wan'~ eat somethin'~.'

Mike: All this just to get a UHF station? 

Case's mouth flooded with saliva; he shook his head.

Armitage announced an eighty-hour stay in Zion.  Molly and

Crow: Let's see now... licorice whips, jujubes, slowpokes, Lon Chaney Junior Mints... 

Case would practice in zero gravity, he said, and acclimatize

themselves to working in it.  He would brief them on Freeside
and the Villa Straylight.  It was unclear what Riviera was sup-
posed to be doing, but Case didn't feel like asking.  A few
hours after their arrival, Armitage had sent him into the yellow
maze to call Riviera out for a meal.  He'd found him curled

Joel: Draw, er... wait a sec! 

like a cat on a thin pad of temperfoam, naked, apparently
asleep, his head orbited by a revolving halo of small white
geometric forms, cubes, spheres, and pyramids.  `Hey, Ri-
viera.'  The ring continued to revolve.  He'd gone back and told
Armitage.  `He's stoned,' Molly said, looking up from the
disassembled parts of her fletcher.  `Leave him be.'
Armitage seemed to think that zero-g would affect Case's

ability to operate in the matrix.  `Don't sweat it,' Case argued,

Crow: Tsch. Bunch of crap.

`I jack in and I'm not here.  It's all the same.'
`Your adrenaline levels are higher,' Armitage said.  `You've
still got SAS.  You won't have time for it to wear off.  You're
going to learn to work with it.'

Crow: It lists Hitler as a "fairly stable veteran of the Great War."

`So I do the run from here?'
`No.  Practice, Case.  Now.  Up in the corridor...'

Mike: He's anatomically correct, and everything!



Lea: Doctor!

Cyberspace, as the deck presented it, had no particular re-
lationship with the deck's physical whereabouts.  When Case
jacked in, he opened his eyes to the familiar configuration of
the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority's Aztec pyramid of
data.
`How you doing, Dixie?'

Servo: Oh, the world's thrown into chaos — earthquakes, floods — but that's fine; you knit your sock.

`I'm dead, Case.  Got enough time in on this Hosaka to
figure that one.'

Mike: Wow, I think I'm in this! 

`How's it feel?'
`It doesn't.'
`Bother you?'
`What bothers me is, nothin'~ does.'

Crow: No, sir. That's paper! 

`How's that?'

Servo: Liquid metal! 

`Had me this buddy in the Russian camp, Siberia, his thumb
was frostbit.  Medics came by and they cut it off.  Month later
he's tossin'~ all night.  Elroy, I said, what's eatin'~ you?  Goddam

says, it's the _other_ goddam thumb.'  When the construct laughed,
it came through as something else, not laughter, but a stab of
cold down Case's spine.  `Do me a favor, boy.'
`What's that, Dix?'
`This scam of yours, when it's over, you erase this goddam
thing.'

Case didn't understand the Zionites.
Aerol, with no particular provocation, related the tale of the
baby who had burst from his forehead and scampered into a
forest of hydroponic ganja.  `Ver'~ small baby, mon, no long'~
you finga.'  He rubbed his palm across an unscarred expanse
of brown forehead and smiled.
`It's the ganja,' Molly said, when Case told her the story.
`They don't make much of a difference between states, you

know?  Aerol tells you it happened, well, it happened to _him._
It's not like bullshit, more like poetry.  Get it?'
Case nodded dubiously.  The Zionites always touched you
when they were talking, hands on your shoulder.  He didn't
like that.
`Hey, Aerol,' Case called, an hour later, as he prepared

Mike: The end... for Johnny at least, you poor dope! 

for a practice run in the freefall corridor.  `Come here, man.
Wanna show you this thing.'  He held out the trodes.
Aerol executed a slow-motion tumble.  His bare feet struck
the steel wall and he caught a girder with his free hand.  The
other held a transparent waterbag bulging with blue-green al-
gae.  He blinked mildly and grinned.
`Try it,' Case said.
He took the band, put it on, and Case adjusted the trodes.
He closed his eyes.  Case hit the power stud.  Aerol shuddered.

Jake: Professor, you know that tape will blow the lid off of everything?

Case jacked him back out.  `What did you see, man?'
`Babylon,' Aerol said, sadly, handing him the trodes and

tended straight out, level with his shoulder.  A jewel-scaled
snake, its eyes like ruby neon, was coiled tightly a few
millimeters behind his elbow.  Case watched the snake, which
was finger-thick and banded black and scarlet, slowly contract,
tightening around Riviera's arm.
`Come then,' the man said caressingly to the pale waxy
scorpion poised in the center of his upturned palm.  `Come.'
The scorpion swayed its brownish claws and scurried up his

relaxed, and Riviera sighed slowly as the injection hit him.
Then the snake and the scorpion were gone, and he held a
milky plastic syringe in his left hand.  ``If God made anything
better, he kept it for himself.'  You know the expression, Case?'
`Yeah,' Case said.  `I heard that about lots of different

The bright eyes met his.  `Of course it does.  That's part of

`I'd just use derms,' Case said.

short-sleeved white cotton shirt.

ity.'
`What's inside, boss?'  Riviera leaned forward, craning his
neck.  Four tiny figures glittered, near the tip of Armitage's
finger.  Armitage slapped at them as if they were gnats.
`Peter,' Armitage said, `you're going to be the first to find
out.  You'll arrange yourself an invitation.  Once you're in, you
see that Molly gets in.'

Servo: So, let's recap the movie so far: somebody went to Acapulco, and somebody almost bought gas. 

Case stared at the blankness that represented Straylight,
remembering the Finn's story: Smith, Jimmy, the talking head,
and the ninja.

Joel: Hey, leave my father out of this!

`Details available?' Riviera asked.  `I need to plan a ward-
robe, you see.'
`Learn the streets,' Armitage said, returning to the center
of the model.  `Desiderata Street here.  This is the Rue Jules
Verne.'
Riviera rolled his eyes.
While Armitage recited the names of Freeside avenues, a
dozen bright pustules rose on his nose, cheeks, and chin.  Even
Molly laughed.
Armitage paused, regarded them all with his cold empty
eyes.

Crow: You know, this is almost as good as 2001... nails driven into your eyes! 

`Sorry,' Riviera said, and the sores flickered and vanished.


Mike: Thank goodness for the internal genitalia!

speed of it stunned him.  She was up and through the sheet of
yellow plastic before he'd had time to realize she'd slashed it
open.
`Don't you move, friend.'
Case rolled over and put his head through the rent in the
plastic.  `Wha...?'
`Shut up.'

Crow: …including Kevin Spacey.

`That is a story we have, sister,' said the other, `a religion

`How come you don't talk the patois?' Molly asked.
`I came from Los Angeles,' the old man said.  His dread-

`Voices.'  The Founder from Los Angeles was staring at

a voice, out of the babel of tongues, speaking to us.  It played

`Call 'em Winter Mute,' said the other, making it two
words.

`The Mute talked to us,' the first Founder said.  `The Mute
said we are to help you.'
`When was this?' Case asked.
`Thirty hours prior you dockin'~ Zion.'

Mike: The Tidy Bowl Man is doing all right for himself.

`You ever hear this voice before?'
`No,' said the man from Los Angeles, `and we are uncertain
of its meaning.  If these are Final Days, we must expect false

`What kinda message the voice have?' Case asked.
`We were told to help you,' the other said, `that you might
serve as a tool of Final Days.'  His lined face was troubled.
`We were told to send Maelcum with you, in his tug _Garvey_
to the Babylon port of Freeside.  And this we shall do.'
`Maelcum a rude boy,' said the other, `an'~ a righteous tug

`But we have decided to send Aerol as well, in _Babylon

An awkward silence filled the dome.

`Maelcum will take you.  Jah love, sister.'

Melissa: I felt like it. I really wanted to fly, but I couldn't do that, so I ran. 

`Case,' she said, `have you maybe done anything toward
getting in touch with our pal from Berne?  Like all that time
you spent in Zion, plugged in with your lips moving?'

Crow: Oh look, it's Shelly Winters and Ernest Borgnine. 

`Pal,' Case said, `sure.  No.  I haven't.  But I got a funny
story along those lines, left over from Istanbul.'  He told her

Capt. Walsh: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Walsh. If you'll look out your windows, you'll see a sight that very few except the astronauts have ever seen.

`Christ,' she said, `there goes a chance.  How come you

`Coulda been anybody,' he lied.  `Just a chip...  I dunno.'
He shrugged.
`Not just 'cause you were scared, huh?'
He shrugged again.

Mike: Uh, you don't need to salute the paleontologist. 

`Do it now.'
`What?'
`Now.  Anyway, talk to the Flatline about it.'

Tommy: Roxie! It's me, Tom!

`I'm all doped,' he protested, but reached for the trodes.
His deck and the Hosaka had been mounted behind Maelcum's
module along with a very high-resolution Cray monitor.
He adjusted the trodes.  _Marcus Garvey_ had been thrown
together around an enormous old Russian air scrubber, a rec-
tangular thing daubed with Rastafarian symbols, Lions of Zion
and Black Star Liners, the reds and greens and yellows over-
laying wordy decals in Cyrillic script.  Someone had sprayed

semirigid globs and streamers of translucent caulk, like clumsy
strands of imitation seaweed.  He glanced past Maelcum's
shoulder to the central screen and saw a docking display: the
tug's path was a line of red dots, Freeside a segmented green
circle.  He watched the line extend itself, generating a new dot.
He jacked in.

Servo: Ah! Hello. Welcome to tonight's Mystery… Murder… Dinner… Party—

Case chewed his lower lip and gazed out across the plateaus
of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, into the infinite
neuroelectronic void of the matrix.  `Tessier-Ashpool, Dixie?'
`Tessier, yeah.'

Servo: And the same caliber as Last Crusade—two-and-a-half stars.

`Sure.  I was crazy.  Figured I'd try to cut it.  Hit the first

`And your EEG was flat.'
`Well, that's the stuff of legend, ain't it?'

`Go on,' she said, `the two of you are supposed to be
dynamite, right?'

Crow: No, sir. That's paper! 



Vince: I'll take care of her.

`Dix,' Case said, `I wanna have a look at an AI in Berne.

Crow: Joel, I thought underwear was supposed to match.

`Not unless you got a morbid fear of death, no.'
Case punched for the Swiss banking sector, feeling a wave

punched again, for Berne.
`Up,' the construct said.  `It'll be high.'
They ascended lattices of light, levels strobing, a blue flicker.
That'll be it, Case thought.
Wintermute was a simple cube of white light, that very
simplicity suggesting extreme complexity.
`Don't look much, does it?' the Flatline said.  `But just you
try and touch it.'
`I'm going in for a pass, Dixie.'
`Be my guest.'

Mike: Mmm… mmm… oh, you smell like a tire store.

Case punched to within four grid points of the cube.  Its
blank face, towering above him now, began to seethe with faint
internal shadows, as though a thousand dancers whirled behind

`Knows we're here,' the Flatline observed.

Jerry: No thanks. The world's my college.

Dr. Forrester: Frank! My towel and your hinder have an appointment, but first we've got to rescue Joel! Oh, no, nooo! Frank, he's landed safely in the Australian outback!

A stippled gray circle formed on the face of the cube.
`Dixie...'
`Back off, fast.'

Mike: Oh no, he made a saddle out of Grover! 

The gray area bulged smoothly, became a sphere, and de-
tached itself from the cube.
Case felt the edge of the deck sting his palm as he slapped
MAX REVERSE.  The matrix blurred backward; they plunged
down a twilit shaft of Swiss banks.  He looked up.  The sphere
was darker now, gaining on him.  Falling.
`Jack out,' the Flatline said.
The dark came down like a hammer.

Cold steel odor and ice caressed his spine.
And faces peering in from a neon forest, sailors and hustlers
and whores, under a poisoned silver sky...
`Look, Case, you tell me what the fuck is going on with
you, you wig or something?'
A steady pulse of pain, midway down his spine --

Rain woke him, a slow drizzle, his feet tangled in coils of
discarded fiberoptics.  The arcade's sea of sound washed over
him, receded, returned.  Rolling over, he sat up and held his

Light from a service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed

of a gutted game console.  Streamlined Japanese was stenciled
across the side of the console in faded pinks and yellows.
He glanced up and saw a sooty plastic window, a faint glow
of fluorescents.
His back hurt, his spine.

Servo: Ah, that's who's playing John Hiller this time.

He got to his feet, brushed wet hair out of his eyes.

Mike: The George Hamilton Story.

He searched his pockets for money, found nothing, and

arcade's entrance.
Holograms twisted and shuddered to the roaring of the games,
ghosts overlapping in the crowded haze of the place, a smell
of sweat and bored tension.  A sailor in a white t-shirt nuked
Bonn on a Tank War console, an azure flash.
She was playing Wizard's Castle, lost in it, her gray eyes

He kissed her.
`You made me blow my game,' she said.  `Look there,

`I don't know.'

`Maybe somebody decked you, baby.  Got your roll intact?'

He shook his head.

Mike: Yeah, I know, they're great, and they all seem to have titles like, uh, Malibu Death Breast.

`I guess so.'
`Come on, then.'  She took his hand.  `We'll get you a coffee

and something to eat.  Take you home.  It's good to see you,

He smiled.
Something cracked.
Something shifted at the core of things.  The arcade froze,
vibrated --

Judy Nelson: Oh, I forgot. I knew there was something... ServoAadgka.

The sailor in the white t-shirt was gone.  The arcade was
empty, silent.  Case turned slowly, his shoulders hunched, teeth
bared, his hands bunched into involuntary fists.  Empty.  A
crumpled yellow candy wrapper, balanced on the edge of a
console, dropped to the floor and lay amid flattened butts and

styrofoam cups.


`I had a cigarette,' Case said, looking down at his white-
knuckled fist.  `I had a cigarette and a girl and a place to sleep.
Do you hear me, you son of a bitch?  You hear me?'
Echoes moved through the hollow of the arcade, fading
down corridors of consoles.
He stepped out into the street.  The rain had stopped.
Ninsei was deserted.

Servo: Oh, no — the jazz combo was in there!! 

Holograms flickered, neon danced.  He smelled boiled veg-
etables from a vendor's pushcart across the street.  An unopened

pack of Yeheyuans lay at his feet, beside a book of matches.

Hargrove: Make it a double, will you?

JULIUS DEANE IMPORT EXPORT.  Case stared at the printed
logo and its Japanese translation.
`Okay,' he said, picking up the matches and opening the
pack of cigarettes.  `I hear you.'


Servo: Mercy?

He took his time climbing the stairs of Deane's office.  No
rush, he told himself, no hurry.  The sagging face of the Dali
clock still told the wrong time.  There was dust on the Kandinsky
table and the Neo-Aztec bookcases.  A wall of white fiberglass
shipping modules filled the room with a smell of ginger.

Servo: I'm choking! I'm choking! I'm choking! Choking! Ahhh! H-He-Help! {Servo's muffled sobs and cries of 'HMMMMMLPH!' are heard offscreen]

`Is the door locked?'  Case waited for an answer, but none
came.  He crossed to the office door and tried it.  `Julie?'

Narrator: From now on, their main job in life is to eat and grow.

The green-shaded brass lamp cast a circle of light on Deane's
desk.  Case stared at the guts of an ancient typewriter, at cas-
settes, crumpled printouts, at sticky plastic bags filled with

Zach: No, no—your mom is fine! She's at the hospital.

ginger samples.


There was no one there.
Case stepped around the broad steel desk and pushed Deane's
chair out of the way.  He found the gun in a cracked leather
holster fastened beneath the desk with silver tape.  It was an
antique, a .357 Magnum with the barrel and trigger-guard sawn
off.  The grip had been built up with layers of masking tape.
The tape was old, brown, shiny with a patina of dirt.  He flipped
the cylinder out and examined each of the six cartridges.  They

were handloads.  The soft lead was still bright and untarnished.
With the revolver in his right hand, Case edged past the
cabinet to the left of the desk and stepped into the center of
the cluttered office, away from the pool of light.
`I guess I'm not in any hurry.  I guess it's your show.  But
all this shit, you know, it's getting kind of... old.'  He raised
the gun with both hands, aiming for the center of the desk,
and pulled the trigger.
The recoil nearly broke his wrist.  The muzzle-flash lit the
office like a flashbulb.  With his ears ringing, he stared at the
jagged hole in the front of the desk.  Explosive bullet.  Azide.
He raised the gun again.
`You needn't do that, old son,' Julie said, stepping out of

Servo: Ohhhhh!

the shadows.  He wore a three-piece drape suit in silk herring-
bone, a striped shirt, and a bow tie.  His glasses winked in the
light.

Mike: Special effects by Industrial Light and Morons.  

Case brought the gun around and looked down the line of
sight at Deane's pink, ageless face.

Joel: I sing the Body Pathetic! Heh. 

`Don't,' Deane said.  `You're right.  About what this all is.

Crow: 'It's about my report card.

speak through her, but I'm generating all this out of your

Mike: Hit him! He'll cry!

I slipped.  Sorry.'
Case lowered the gun.  `This is the matrix.  You're Winter-
mute.'
`Yes.  This is all coming to you courtesy of the simstim unit
wired into your deck, of course.  I'm glad I was able to cut you
off before you'd managed to jack out.'  Deane walked around
the desk, straightened his chair, and sat down.  `Sit, old son.

Crow: Have you seen the outtakes for this film?

We have a lot to talk about.'
`Do we?'
`Of course we do.  We have had for some time.  I was ready

when I reached you by phone in Istanbul.  Time's very short
now.  You'll be making your run in a matter of days, Case.'
Deane picked up a bonbon and stripped off its checkered wrap-
per, popped it into his mouth.  `Sit,' he said around the candy.
Case lowered himself into the swivel chair in front of the
desk without taking his eyes off Deane.  He sat with the gun
in his hand, resting it on his thigh.
`Now,' Deane said briskly, `order of the day.  `What,' you're
asking yourself, `is Wintermute?'  Am I right?'
`More or less.'

Crow: Oh, it works, Mike. Heh heh heh.

`An artificial intelligence, but you know that.  Your mistake,
and it's quite a logical one, is in confusing the Wintermute
mainframe, Berne, with the Wintermute _entity.'_  Deane sucked
his bonbon noisily.  `You're already aware of the other AI in

Crow: Yeah, and it's made out of coconuts. 

`If you're so goddam smart...'
`Why ain't I rich?'  Deane laughed, and nearly choked on
his bonbon.  `Well, Case, all I can say to that, and I really
don't have nearly as many answers as you imagine I do, is that
what you think of as Wintermute is only a part of another, a,

aspect of that entity's brain.  It's rather like dealing, from your
point of view, with a man whose lobes have been severed.  Let's
say you're dealing with a small part of the man's left brain.
Difficult to say if you're dealing with the man at all, in a case
like that.'  Deane smiled.
`Is the Corto story true?  You got to him through a micro

`Yes.  And I assembled the file you accessed in London.  I
try to plan, in your sense of the word, but that isn't my basic
mode, really.  I improvise.  It's my greatest talent.  I prefer
situations to plans, you see...  Really, I've had to deal with
givens.  I can sort a great deal of information, and sort it very
quickly.  It's taken a very long time to assemble the team you're
a part of.  Corto was the first, and he very nearly didn't make
it.  Very far gone, in Toulon.  Eating, excreting, and mastur-
bating were the best he could manage.  But the underlying
structure of obsessions was there: Screaming Fist, his betrayal,
the Congressional hearings.'
`Is he still crazy?'
`He's not quite a personality.'  Deane smiled.  `But I'm sure
you're aware of that.  But Corto is in there, somewhere, and I
can no longer maintain that delicate balance.  He's going to
come apart on you, Case.  So I'll be counting on you...'
`That's good, motherfucker,' Case said, and shot him in

He'd been right about the brains.  And the blood.

He was numb, as they went through customs, and Molly
did most of the talking.  Maelcum remained on board _Garvey._

Servo: Mork calling Orson...

Customs, for Freeside, consisted mainly of proving your credit.

Mike: So I'm a chicken for not stabbing myself--that's all you needed to say! 

The first thing he saw, when they gained the inner surface of
the spindle, was a branch of the Beautiful Girl coffee franchise.

Servo: Love this lady.

`Welcome to the Rue Jules Verne,' Molly said.  `If you

have trouble walking, just look at your feet.  The perspective's
a bitch, if you're not used to it.'
They were standing in a broad street that seemed to be the
floor of a deep slot or canyon, its either end concealed by subtle
angles in the shops and buildings that formed its walls.  The
light, here, was filtered through fresh green masses of vege-
tation tumbling from overhanging tiers and balconies that rose
above them.  The sun...
There was a brilliant slash of white somewhere above them,
too bright, and the recorded blue of a Cannes sky.  He knew
that sunlight was pumped in with a Lado-Acheson system whose
two-millimeter armature ran the length of the spindle, that they
generated a rotating library of sky effects around it, that if the
sky were turned off, he'd stare up past the armature of light
to the curves of lakes, rooftops of casinos, other streets...
But it made no sense to his body.
`Jesus,' he said, `I like this less than SAS.'
`Get used to it.  I was a gambler's bodyguard here for a
month.'

Kalgan: I'm going to use this laser on your teeth. It's not unsimilar to ancient dentistry, not that you'd know anything about that.

`Wanna go somewhere, lie down.'
`Okay.  I got our keys.'  She touched his shoulder.  `What
happened to you, back there, man?  You flatlined.'

Narrator: Flag on the moon. How'd it get there?

He shook his head.  `I dunno, yet.  Wait.'
`Okay.  We get a cab or something.'  She took his hand and
led him across Jules Verne, past a window displaying the sea-

`Unreal,' he said, looking up again.
`Nah,' she responded, assuming he meant the furs, `grow

Servo: Hey, pal, feed me, then clean up my poops! 


`It's just a big tube and they pour things through it,' Molly
said.  `Tourists, hustlers, anything.  And there's fine mesh money
screens working every minute, make sure the money stays here
when the people fall back down the well.'
Armitage had booked them into a place called the Inter-
continental, a sloping glass-fronted cliff face that slid down
into cold mist and the sound of rapids.  Case went out onto
their balcony and watched a trio of tanned French teenagers
ride simple hang gliders a few meters above the spray, triangles

of nylon in bright primary colors.  One of them swung, banked,
and Case caught a flash of cropped dark hair, brown breasts,
white teeth in a wide smile.  The air here smelled of running
water and flowers.  `Yeah,' he said, `lotta money.'
She leaned beside him against the railing, her hands loose
and relaxed.  `Yeah.  We were gonna come here once, either
here or some place in Europe.'
`We who?'
`Nobody,' she said, giving her shoulders an involuntary

`Yeah,' Case said, rubbing his palms across his cheek-

bones.  `Yeah, this is some place.'
The narrow band of the Lado-Acheson system smoldered
in abstract imitation of some Bermudan sunset, striped by shreds
of recorded cloud.  `Yeah,' he said, `sleep.'
Sleep wouldn't come.  When it did, it brought dreams that
were like neatly edited segments of memory.  He woke re-
peatedly, Molly curled beside him, and heard the water, voices
drifting in through the open glass panels of the balcony, a
woman's laughter from the stepped condos on the opposite
slope.  Deane's death kept turning up like a bad card, no matter
if he told himself that it hadn't been Deane.  That it hadn't, in
fact, happened at all.  Someone had once told him that the
amount of blood in the average human body was roughly equiv-
alent to a case of beer.
Each time the image of Deane's shattered head struck the
rear wall of the office, Case was aware of another thought,
something darker, hidden, that rolled away, diving like a fish,
just beyond his reach.
Linda.
Deane.  Blood on the wall of the importer's office.
Linda.  Smell of burnt flesh in the shadows of the Chiba

dome.  Molly holding out a bag of ginger, the plastic filmed
with blood.  Deane had had her killed.
Wintermute.  He imagined a little micro whispering to the
wreck of a man named Corto, the words flowing like a river,
the flat personality-substitute called Armitage accreting slowly
in some darkened ward...  The Deane analog had said it
worked with givens, took advantage of existing situations.
But what if Deane, the real Deane, had ordered Linda killed
on Wintermute's orders?  Case groped in the dark for a cigarette
and Molly's lighter.  There was no reason to suspect Deane, he
told himself, lighting up.  No reason.
Wintermute could build a kind of personality into a shell.

Mike: Wow! Dangerously steep stairs!

How subtle a form could manipulation take?  He stubbed the
Yeheyuan out in a bedside ashtray after his third puff, rolled
away from Molly, and tried to sleep.
The dream, the memory, unreeled with the monotony of an
unedited simstim tape.  He'd spent a month, his fifteenth sum-
mer, in a weekly rates hotel, fifth floor, with a girl called
Marlene.  The elevator hadn't worked in a decade.  Roaches
boiled across grayish porcelain in the drain-plugged kitchenette
when you flicked a lightswitch.  He slept with Marlene on a
striped mattress with no sheets.
He'd missed the first wasp, when it built its paperfine gray
house on the blistered paint of the windowframe, but soon the
nest was a fist-sized lump of fiber, insects hurtling out to hunt
the alley below like miniature copters buzzing the rotting con-
tents of the dumpsters.
They'd each had a dozen beers, the afternoon a wasp stung

Marlene.  `Kill the fuckers,' she said, her eyes dull with rage
and the still heat of the room, `burn 'em.'  Drunk, Case rum-
maged in the sour closet for Rollo's dragon.  Rollo was Mar-

a Frisco flamethrower, a thing like a fat anglehead flashlight.
Case checked the batteries, shook it to make sure he had enough
fuel, and went to the open window.  The hive began to buzz.
The air in the Sprawl was dead, immobile.  A wasp shot
from the nest and circled Case's head.  Case pressed the ignition
switch, counted three, and pulled the trigger.  The fuel, pumped
up to 100 psi, sprayed out past the white-hot coil.  A five-meter
tongue of pale fire, the nest charring, tumbling.  Across the

alley, someone cheered.
`Shit!'  Marlene behind him, swaying.  `Stupid!  You didn't
burn 'em.  You just knocked it off.  They'll come up here and
kill us!'  Her voice sawing at his nerves, he imagined her en-
gulfed in flame, her bleached hair sizzling a special green.

Mike: Well, oka— no!

In the alley, the dragon in hand, he approached the black-
ened nest.  It had broken open.  Singed wasps wrenched and
flipped on the asphalt.
He saw the thing the shell of gray paper had concealed.
Horror.  The spiral birth factory, stepped terraces of the
hatching cells, blind jaws of the unborn moving ceaselessly,
the staged progress from egg to larva, near-wasp, wasp.  In his
mind's eye, a kind of time-lapse photography took place, re-
vealing the thing as the biological equivalent of a machine gun,
hideous in its perfection.  Alien.  He pulled the trigger, forgetting

to press the ignition, and fuel hissed over the bulging, writhing

life at his feet.
When he did hit the ignition, it exploded with a thump,
taking an eyebrow with it.  Five floors above him, from the
open window, he heard Marlene laughing.
He woke with the impression of light fading, but the room
was dark.  Afterimages, retinal flares.  The sky outside hinted
at the start of a recorded dawn.  There were no voices now,
only the rush of water, far down the face of the Intercontinental.
In the dream, just before he'd drenched the nest with fuel,
he'd seen the T-A logo of Tessier-Ashpool neatly embossed
into its side, as though the wasps themselves had worked it
there.

Molly insisted on coating him with bronzer, saying his Sprawl
pallor would attract too much attention.
`Christ,' he said, standing naked in front of the mirror,
`you think that looks real?'  She was using the last of the tube
on his left ankle, kneeling beside him.
`Nah, but it looks like you care enough to fake it.  There.
There isn't enough to do your foot.'  She stood, tossing the

empty tube into a large wicker basket.  Nothing in the room
looked as though it had been machine-made or produced from
synthetics.  Expensive, Case knew, but it was a style that had
always irritated him.  The temperfoam of the huge bed was
tinted to resemble sand.  There was a lot of pale wood and
handwoven fabric.


`What about you,' he said, `you gonna dye yourself brown?

Servo: No really, I'm very high-strung and in need of some "Mary Jane" or "reefers!" 

Don't exactly look like you spend all your time sunbathing.'
She wore loose black silks and black espadrilles.  `I'm an

look like a cheap-ass hood who's up for what he can get, so
the instant tan's okay.'
Case regarded his pallid foot morosely, then looked at him-
self in the mirror.  `Christ.  You mind if I get dressed now?'
He went to the bed and began to pull his jeans on.  `You sleep
okay?  You notice any lights?'

Servo: Now who in Creation is powerful enough to do that?!

`You were dreaming,' she said.
They had breakfast on the roof of the hotel, a kind of meadow,
studded with striped umbrellas and what seemed to Case an
unnatural number of trees.  He told her about his attempt to
buzz the Berne AI.  The whole question of bugging seemed to
have become academic.  If Armitage were tapping them, he'd
be doing it through Wintermute.
`And it was like real?' she asked, her mouth full of cheese
croissant.  `Like simstim?'
He said it was.  `Real as this,' he added, looking around.

Servo: Oh, anything that's not handwritten on papyrus will do. 

`Maybe more.'
The trees were small, gnarled, impossibly old, the result of
genetic engineering and chemical manipulation.  Case would
have been hard pressed to distinguish a pine from an oak, but
a street boy's sense of style told him that these were too cute,
too entirely and definitively treelike.  Between the trees, on
gentle and too cleverly irregular slopes of sweet green grass,
the bright umbrellas shaded the hotel's guests from the unfal-
tering radiance of the Lado-Acheson sun.  A burst of French
from a nearby table caught his attention: the golden children
he'd seen gliding above river mist the evening before.  Now he
saw that their tans were uneven, a stencil effect produced by
selective melanin boosting, multiple shades overlapping in rec-
tilinear patterns, outlining and highlighting musculature, the

for racing; they deserved decals for their hairdressers, the de-
signers of their white cotton ducks, for the artisans who'd
crafted their leather sandals and simple jewelry.  Beyond them,

though his regimental patches had just been stripped, Riviera
in a loose gray seersucker outfit that perversely suggested prison.
`Molly, love,' Riviera said, almost before he was settled
on his chair, `you'll have to dole me out more of the medicine.
I'm out.'
`Peter,' she said, `and what if I won't?'  She smiled without
showing her teeth.
`You will,' Riviera said, his eyes cutting to Armitage and
back.
`Give it to him,' Armitage said.
`Pig for it, aren't you?'  She took a flat, foil-wrapped packet

from an inside pocket and flipped it across the table.  Riviera
caught it in midair.  `He could off himself,' she said to Ar-
mitage.
`I have an audition this afternoon,' Riviera said.  `I'll need
to be at my best.'  He cupped the foil packet in his upturned
palm and smiled.  Small glittering insects swarmed out of it,
vanished.  He dropped it into the pocket of his seersucker blouse.
`You've got an audition yourself, Case, this afternoon,'
Armitage said.  `On that tug.  I want you to get over to the pro
shop and get yourself fitted for a vac suit, get checked out on
it, and get out to the boat.  You've got about three hours.'

Aerol had ferried him out to _Marcus Garvey_ in a skeletal

`Two hour ago,' Maelcum said, `I take delivery of Babylon

`Okay.  Well, you leave me to it, okay?'
Maelcum kicked off and drifted past the pilot console, bus-
ying himself with a caulk gun.  Case hastily looked away from
the waving fronds of transparent caulk.  He wasn't sure why,
but something about them brought back the nausea of SAS.
`What is this thing?' he asked the Hosaka.  `Parcel for me.'

of her day in Macao.  Armitage had crossed the border into

`Delay for interorbital transmission,' said the Hosaka.
`Code it.  Standard commercial code.'

it's paying us to burn it.  It's burning itself.  And something that
calls itself Wintermute is trying to get on my good side, get
me to maybe shaft Armitage.  What goes?'
`Motive,' the construct said.  `Real motive problem, with
an AI.  Not human, see?'
`Well, yeah, obviously.'
`Nope.  I mean, it's not human.  And you can't get a handle
on it.  Me, I'm not human either, but I _respond_ like one.  See?'
`Wait a sec,' Case said.  `Are you sentient, or not?'
`Well, it _feels_ like I am, kid, but I'm really just a bunch of
ROM.  It's one of them, ah, philosophical questions, I guess...'

Mike: These'll never go out of style.

The ugly laughter sensation rattled down Case's spine.  `But I
ain't likely to write you no poem, if you follow me.  Your AI,
it just might.  But it ain't no way _human.'_
`So you figure we can't get on to its motive?'
`It own itself?'

Servo: And a shower, and a job.

`Swiss citizen, but T-A own the basic software and the

Natalie: Well, maybe then it's too late!

`That's a good one,' the construct said.  `Like, I own your
brain and what you know, but your thoughts have Swiss citi-
zenship.  Sure.  Lotsa luck, AI.'
`So it's getting ready to burn itself?'  Case began to punch
the deck nervously, at random.  The matrix blurred, resolved,
and he saw the complex of pink spheres representing a sikkim
steel combine.
`Autonomy, that's the bugaboo, where your AI's are con-
cerned.  My guess, Case, you're going in there to cut the hard-
wired shackles that keep this baby from getting any smarter.

the nonlaugh.  `See, those things, they can work real hard, buy

The half sense of someone reading over his shoulder was
gone for a few seconds, then returned.  `Hot shit.  Case.  It's a

`Or an AI.'  He sighed.  `Can we run it?'

`Sometimes you repeat yourself, man.'

Crow: Stepdad, could you help me with my science fair project?

`It's my nature.'

Molly was sleeping when he returned to the Intercontinental.
He sat on the balcony and watched a microlight with rainbow
polymer wings as it soared up the curve of Freeside, its tri-
angular shadow tracking across meadows and rooftops, until

Servo: Except Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister, Grandpa, Grandma... 

it vanished behind the band of the Lado-Acheson system.
`I wanna buzz,' he said to the blue artifice of the sky.  `I
truly do wanna get high, you know?  Trick pancreas, plugs in
my liver, little bags of shit melting, fuck it all.  I wanna buzz.'
He left without waking Molly, he thought.  He was never
sure, with the glasses.  He shrugged tension from his shoulders
and got into the elevator.  He rode up with an Italian girl in
spotless whites, cheekbones and nose daubed with something
black and nonreflective.  Her white nylon shoes had steel cleats;
the expensive-looking thing in her hand resembled a cross be-
tween a miniature oar and an orthopedic brace.  She was off

On the roof meadow, he made his way through the grove
of trees and umbrellas, until he found a pool, naked bodies
gleaming against turquoise tiles.  He edged into the shadow of

an awning and pressed his chip against a dark glass plate.
`Sushi,' he said, `whatever you got.'  Ten minutes later, an
enthusiastic Chinese waiter arrived with his food.  He munched
raw tuna and rice and watched people tan.  `Christ,' he said,
to his tuna, `I'd go nuts.'
`Don't tell me,' someone said, `I know it already.  You're
a gangster, right?'

Disinfester: You should have left earlier. Eliminate!

He squinted up at her, against the band of sun.  A long young
body and a melanin-boosted tan, but not one of the Paris jobs.
She squatted beside his chair, dripping water on the tiles.
`Cath,' she said.
`Lupus,' after a pause.
`What kind of name is that?'

Crow: He's got a foreign object!

`Greek,' he said.
`Are you really a gangster?'  The melanin boost hadn't pre-
vented the formation of freckles.
`I'm a drug addict, Cath.'

Crow: She's nude!

`What kind?'
`Stimulants.  Central nervous system stimulants.  Extremely
powerful central nervous system stimulants.'
`Well, do you _have_ any?'  She leaned closer.  Drops of
chlorinated water fell on the leg of his pants.
`No.  That's my problem, Cath.  Do you know where we
can get some?'

Crow: I'm gonna have to take a sweater. My legs are old, my teeth are grey… 

Cath rocked back on her tanned heels and licked at a strand
of brownish hair that had pasted itself beside her mouth.  `What's
your taste?'
`No coke, no amphetamines, but _up,_ gotta be _up.'_  And so
much for that, he thought glumly, holding his smile for her.
`Betaphenethylamine,' she said.  `No sweat, but it's on your
chip.'

`You're kidding,' said Cath's partner and roommate, when
Case explained the peculiar properties of his Chiba pancreas.
`I mean, can't you sue them or something?  Malpractice?'  His
name was Bruce.  He looked like a gender switch version of
Cath, right down to the freckles.
`Well,' Case said, `it's just one of those things, you know?
Like tissue matching and all that.'  But Bruce's eyes had already
gone numb with boredom.  Got the attention span of a gnat,
Case thought, watching the boy's brown eyes.
Their room was smaller than the one Case shared with Molly,
and on another level, closer to the surface.  Five huge Ciba-

Mike Cutout: Well, I think we all learned a valuable lesson about hobgoblins today...

`Yeah,' Case said, suddenly uneasy, `terrible thing.'

a rictus of delight, `beautiful.'

She laughed.  `It won't last.'
`But it will,' he said, climbing into the sand-colored tem-
perfoam, `that's what's so _unnatural_ about it.'

on a small lake near the Intercontinental.

Servo: ...stinks to high heaven! 

Case shuddered.  Bruce hadn't said anything about after ef-
fects.  He tried to pick up a glass of ice water, but his hands
were shaking.  `Something I ate, maybe.'
`I want you checked out by a medic,' Armitage said.
`Just this hystamine reaction,' Case lied.  `Get it when I
travel, eat different stuff, sometimes.'
Armitage wore a dark suit, too formal for the place, and a
white silk shirt.  His gold bracelet rattled as he raised his wine
and sipped.  `I've ordered for you,' he said.
Molly and Armitage ate in silence, while Case sawed shakily
at his steak, reducing it to uneaten bite-sized fragments, which
he pushed around in the rich sauce, finally abandoning the
whole thing.

Mike: Look, your dad's not responsible for everything that happens in the world!

`Jesus,' Molly said, her own plate empty, `gimme that.
You know what this costs?'  She took his plate.  `They gotta
raise a whole animal for years and then they kill it.  This isn't
vat stuff.'  She forked a mouthful up and chewed.

Magic Voice: We'll be right back... I think. Noel! 

`Not hungry,' Case managed.  His brain was deep-fried.
No, he decided, it had been thrown into hot fat and left there,
and the fat had cooled, a thick dull grease congealing on the
wrinkled lobes, shot through with greenish-purple flashes of

The lights dimmed.

Crow: If Disappearing Elf Hide-and-seek were in the Olympics, Finland would be in great shape! 

`Le Restaurant Vingtime Sicle,' said a disembodied voice
with a pronounced Sprawl accent, `proudly presents the hol-
ographic cabaret of Mr.~ Peter Riviera.'  Scattered applause from
the other tables.  A waiter lit a single candle and placed it in
the center of their table, then began to remove the dishes.  Soon
a candle flickered at each of the restaurant's dozen tables, and
drinks were being poured.

Joel: But they were just stupid! 

`What's happening?' Case asked Armitage, who said noth-

ing.
Molly picked her teeth with a burgundy nail.
`Good evening,' Riviera said, stepping forward on a small
stage at the far end of the room.  Case blinked.  In his discomfort,

Servo: Well don't, son.

he hadn't noticed the stage.  He hadn't seen where Riviera had
come from.  His uneasiness increased.
At first he assumed the man was illuminated by a spotlight.
Riviera glowed.  The light clung around him like a skin, lit
the dark hangings behind the stage.  He was projecting.
Riviera smiled.  He wore a white dinner jacket.  On his lapel,
blue coals burned in the depths of a black carnation.  His fin-
gernails flashed as he raised his hands in a gesture of greeting,
an embrace for his audience.  Case heard the shallow water lap
against the side of the restaurant.
`Tonight,' Riviera said, his long eyes shining, `I would

like to perform an extended piece for you.  A new work.'  A
cool ruby of light formed in the palm of his upraised right hand.
He dropped it.  A gray dove fluttered up from the point of
impact and vanished into the shadows.  Someone whistled.  More
applause.
`The title of the work is `The Doll.''  Riviera lowered his
hands.  `I wish to dedicate its premiere here, tonight, to Lady
3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool.'  A wave of polite ap-
plause.  As it died, Riviera's eyes seemed to find their table.
`And to another lady.'

Crow: Aw, let's just cheat!

The restaurant's lights died entirely, for a few seconds,
leaving only the glow of candles.  Riviera's holographic aura
had faded with the lights, but Case could still see him, standing
with his head bowed.
Lines of faint light began to form, verticals and horizontals,
sketching an open cube around the stage.  The restaurant's lights
had come back up slightly, but the framework surrounding the
stage might have been constructed of frozen moonbeams.  Head
bowed, eyes closed, arms rigid at his sides, Riviera seemed to
quiver with concentration.  Suddenly the ghostly cube was filled,
had become a room, a room lacking its fourth wall, allowing
the audience to view its contents.
Riviera seemed to relax slightly.  He raised his head, but
kept his eyes closed.  `I'd always lived in the room,' he said.

Joel: Zintar gets the most sales because he's a shapeshifter! 

`I couldn't remember ever having lived in any other room.'
The room's walls were yellowed white plaster.  It contained

two pieces of furniture.  One was a plain wooden chair, the
other an iron bedstead painted white.  The paint had chipped
and flaked, revealing the black iron.  The mattress on the bed
was bare.  Stained ticking with faded brown stripes.  A single
bulb dangled above the bed on a twisted length of black wire.
Case could see the thick coating of dust on the bulb's upper
curve.  Riviera opened his eyes.
`I'd been alone in the room, always.'  He sat on the chair,

facing the bed.  The blue coals still burned in the black flower
on his lapel.  `I don't know when I first began to dream of
her,' he said, `but I do remember that at first she was only a
haze, a shadow.'
There was something on the bed.  Case blinked.  Gone.
`I couldn't quite hold her, hold her in my mind.  But I wanted
to hold her, hold her and more...'  His voice carried perfectly

glass.  Someone giggled.  Someone else asked a whispered ques-

the most perfect detail...'
A woman's hand lay on the mattress now, palm up, the
white fingers pale.
Riviera leaned forward, picked up the hand, and began to
stroke it gently.  The fingers moved.  Riviera raised the hand to

were coated with a burgundy lacquer.
A hand, Case saw, but not a severed hand; the skin swept
back smoothly, unbroken and unscarred.  He remembered a
tattooed lozenge of vatgrown flesh in the window of a Ninsei
surgical boutique.  Riviera was holding the hand to his lips,
licking its palm.  The fingers tentatively caressed his face.  But

Servo: Did the tree contribute money to the film? Why are they showing this? 

now a second hand lay on the bed.  When Riviera reached for
it, the fingers of the first were locked around his wrist, a bracelet
of flesh and bone.
The act progressed with a surreal internal logic of its own.

Servo: Your last clear chance... for fantastic savings! 

The arms were next.  Feet.  Legs.  The legs were very beautiful.
Case's head throbbed.  His throat was dry.  He drank the last
of the wine.
Riviera was in the bed now, naked.  His clothing had been
a part of the projection, but Case couldn't remember seeing it
fade away.  The black flower lay at the foot of the bed, still
seething with its blue inner flame.  Then the torso formed, as
Riviera caressed it into being, white, headless, and perfect,
sheened with the faintest gloss of sweat.

Crow: Using Joe Camel to sell cigarettes to kids seems like a pretty ripe slice of Hell.

Molly's body.  Case stared, his mouth open.  But it wasn't
Molly; it was Molly as Riviera imagined her.  The breasts were
wrong, the nipples larger, too dark.  Riviera and the limbless
torso writhed together on the bed, crawled over by the hands
with their bright nails.  The bed was thick now with folds of
yellowed, rotting lace that crumbled at a touch.  Motes of dust
boiled around Riviera and the twitching limbs, the scurrying,

pinching, caressing hands.
Case glanced at Molly.  Her face was blank; the colors of
Riviera's projection heaved and turned in her mirrors.  Armitage
was leaning forward, his hands round the stem of a wineglass,
his pale eyes fixed on the stage, the glowing room.
Now limbs and torso had merged, and Riviera shuddered.
The head was there, the image complete.  Molly's face, with
smooth quicksilver drowning the eyes.  Riviera and the Molly-
image began to couple with a renewed intensity.  Then the image
slowly extended a clawed hand and extruded its five blades.
With a languorous, dreamlike deliberation, it raked Riviera's
bare back.  Case caught a glimpse of exposed spine, but he was
already up and stumbling for the door.
He vomited over a rosewood railing into the quiet waters
of the lake.  Something that had seemed to close around his

head like a vise had released him now.  Kneeling, his cheek
against the cool wood, he stared across the shallow lake at the
bright aura of the Rue Jules Verne.
Case had seen the medium before; when he'd been a teenager

a van full of gear and a clumsy trode helmet.
What Riviera dreamed, you got.  Case shook his aching head
and spat into the lake.
He could guess the end, the finale.  There was an inverted
symmetry: Riviera puts the dreamgirl together, the dreamgirl
takes him apart.  With those hands.  Dreamblood soaking the
rotten lace.
Cheers from the restaurant, applause.  Case stood and ran

Joel: Well, I s'pose he's got a tank in the courtyard, now.

his hands over his clothes.  He turned and walked back into the
Vingtime Sicle.
Molly's chair was empty.  The stage was deserted.  Armitage
sat alone, still staring at the stage, the stem of the wineglass
between his fingers.
`Where is she?' Case asked.
`Gone,' Armitage said.
`She go after him?'
`No.'  There was a soft _tink._  Armitage looked down at the
glass.  His left hand came up holding the bulb of glass with its
measure of red wine.  The broken stem protruded like a sliver
of ice.  Case took it from him and set it in a water glass.
`Tell me where she went, Armitage.'
The lights came up.  Case looked into the pale eyes.  Nothing
there at all.  `She's gone to prepare herself.  You won't see her
again.  You'll be together during the run.'
`Why did Riviera do that to her?'
Armitage stood, adjusting the lapels of his jacket.  `Get some

`We run, tomorrow?'
Armitage smiled his meaningless smile and walked away,
toward the exit.
Case rubbed his forehead and looked around the room.  The

noticed the balcony for the first time, candles still flickering

there in private darkness.  He heard the clink of silverware,
muted conversation.  The candles threw dancing shadows on
the ceiling.

Narrator: Most of us think that these people were really free...

The girl's face appeared as abruptly as one of Riviera's
projections, her small hands on the polished wood of the bal-
ustrade; she leaned forward, face rapt, it seemed to him, her
dark eyes intent on something beyond.  The stage.  It was a
striking face, but not beautiful.  Triangular, the cheekbones high
yet strangely fragile-looking, mouth wide and firm, balanced
oddly by a narrow, avian nose with flaring nostrils.  And then

Servo: Is there a bar?

she was gone, back into private laughter and the dance of
candles.

Servo: Uh-uh. Candles and everything...

As he left the restaurant, he noticed the two young French-
men and their girlfriend, who were waiting for the boat to the
far shore and the nearest casino.

Their room was silent, the temperfoam smooth as some
beach after a retreating tide.  Her bag was gone.  He looked for
a note.  There was nothing.  Several seconds passed before the
scene beyond the window registered through his tension and
unhappiness.  He looked up and saw a view of Desiderata,
expensive shops: Gucci, Tsuyako, Hermes, Liberty.
He stared, then shook his head and crossed to a panel he

hadn't bothered examining.  He turned the hologram off and
was rewarded with the condos that terraced the far slope.
He picked up the phone and carried it out to the cool balcony.
`Get me a number for the _Marcus Garvey,'_ he told the
desk.  `It's a tug, registered out of Zion cluster.'
The chip voice recited a ten-digit number.  `Sir,' it added,
`the registration in question is Panamanian.'
Maelcum answered on the fifth tone.  `Yo?'
`Case.  You got a modem, Maelcum?'
`Yo.  On th'~ navigation comp, ya know.'
`Can you get it off for me, man?  Put it on my Hosaka.
Then turn my deck on.  It's the stud with the ridges on it.'
`How you doin'~ in there, mon?'

Mike: Are we not blokes?

`Well, I need some help.'

Mike: …James Joyce.

`Movin'~, mon.  I get th'~ modem.'
Case listened to faint static while Maelcum attached the
simple phone link.  `Ice this,' he told the Hosaka, when he
heard it beep.
`You are speaking from a heavily monitored location,' the

`Hey, Case.'  The Flatline spoke through the Hosaka's voice

`Dix, you're about to punch your way in here and get
something for me.  You can be as blunt as you want.  Molly's
in here somewhere and I wanna know where.  I'm in 335W,
the Intercontinental.  She was registered here too, but I don't
know what name she was using.  Ride in on this phone and do
their records for me.'
`No sooner said,' the Flatline said.  Case heard the white
sound of the invasion.  He smiled.  `Done.  Rose Kolodny.
Checked out.  Take me a few minutes to screw their security
net deep enough to get a fix.'
`Go.'
The phone whined and clicked with the construct's efforts.
Case carried it back into the room and put the receiver face up
on the temperfoam.  He went into the bathroom and brushed
his teeth.  As he was stepping back out, the monitor on the
room's Braun audiovisual complex lit up.  A Japanese pop star
reclining against metallic cushions.  An unseen interviewer asked
a question in German.  Case stared.  The screen jumped with
jags of blue interference.  `Case, baby, you lose your mind,
man?'  The voice was slow, familiar.
The glass wall of the balcony clicked in with its view of
Desiderata, but the street scene blurred, twisted, became the
interior of the Jarre de Th, Chiba, empty, red neon replicated
to scratched infinity in the mirrored walls.
Lonny Zone stepped forward, tall and cadaverous, moving
with the slow undersea grace of his addiction.  He stood alone
among the square tables, his hands in the pockets of his gray
sharkskin slacks.  `Really, man, you're lookin'~ very scattered.'
The voice came from the Braun's speakers.

Crow: Also known as "Ace", by the way.

`Wintermute,' Case said.
The pimp shrugged languidly and smiled.
`Where's Molly?'
`Never you mind.  You're screwing up tonight, Case.  The
Flatline's ringing bells all over Freeside.  I didn't think you'd
do that, man.  It's outside the profile.'
`So tell me where she is and I'll call him off.'
Zone shook his head.

Crow: Ness and his men speed towards Capone's hideout! 

`You can't keep too good track of your women, can you,
Case.  Keep losin'~ 'em, one way or another.'
`I'll bring this thing down around your ears,' Case said.
`No.  You aren't that kind, man.  I know that.  You know
something, Case?  I figure you've got it figured out that it was

`Don't,' Case said, taking an involuntary step toward the

You couldn't handle it.  She's dead.'
Case's fist glanced off the glass.
`Don't fuck up the hands, man.  Soon you punch deck.'
Zone vanished, replaced by Freeside night and the lights of
the condos.  The Braun shut off.
From the bed, the phone bleated steadily.
`Case?'  The Flatline was waiting.  `Where you been?  I got

naked in his doorway, dripping wet, his pupils enormous.  `But
we're just having a shower.  You wanna wait?  Wanna shower?'
`No.  Thanks.  I want some help.'  He pushed the boy's arm
aside and stepped into the room.
`Hey, really, man, we're...'

Mike: Eww, someone threw a match on the Cuyahoga River.

`Going to help me.  You're really glad to see me.  Because
we're friends, right?  Aren't we?'

Crow: This door sounds brown! 

Bruce blinked.  `Sure.'
Case recited the address the Flatline had given him.

Crow: Had this been an actual date, you would have been instructed where to go. 

`I knew he was a gangster,' Cath called cheerfully from

Narrator: The group from France.

`I gotta Honda trike,' Bruce said, grinning vacantly.
`We go now,' Case said.

`That level's the cubicles,' Bruce said, after asking Case
to repeat the address for the eighth time.  He climbed back into
the Honda.  Condensation dribbled from the hydrogen-cell ex-
haust as the red fiberglass chassis swayed on chromed shocks.
`You be long?'
`No saying.  But you'll wait.'

`You expected, Lupus?'  Cath craned forward over Bruce's
shoulder and peered up.  The drive had dried her hair.
`Not really,' Case said.  `That's a problem?'
`Just go down to the lowest level and find your friend's
cubicle.  If they let you in, fine.  If they don't wanna see you...'
She shrugged.
Case turned and descended a spiral staircase of floral iron.
Six turns and he'd reached a nightclub.  He paused and lit a

crowd was mixed; maybe half were tourists, the other half
residents of the islands.
`Downstairs,' he said to a passing waiter, `I want to go

downstairs.'  He showed his Freeside chip.  The man gestured
toward the rear of the club.
He walked quickly past the crowded tables, hearing frag-
ments of half a dozen European languages as he passed.

Joel: He's got Bette Davis eyes.

`I want a cubicle,' he said to the girl who sat at the low
desk, a terminal on her lap.  `Lower level.'  He handed her his
chip.
`Gender preference?'  She passed the chip across a glass
plate on the face of the terminal.
`Female,' he said automatically.
`Number thirty-five.  Phone if it isn't satisfactory.  You can
access our special services display beforehand, if you like.'

Joel: Saps all your powers if you're a visitor from foreign planet. 

She smiled.  She returned his chip.
An elevator slid open behind her.
The corridor lights were blue.  Case stepped out of the el-
evator and chose a direction at random.  Numbered doors.  A
hush like the halls of an expensive clinic.
He found his cubicle.  He'd been looking for Molly's, now,
confused, he raised his chip and placed it against a black sensor
set directly beneath the number plate.
Magnetic locks.  The sound reminded him of Cheap Hotel.

Mike: Bye-bye, everyone.

The girl sat up in bed and said something in German.  Her
eyes were soft and unblinking.  Automatic pilot.  A neural cut-
out.  He backed out of the cubicle and closed the door.
The door of forty-three was like all the others.  He hesitated.

Wikowski: Oh, I merely wanted to introduce myself to you...

The silence of the hallway said that the cubicles were sound-
proof.  It was pointless to try the chip.  He rapped his knuckles
against enameled metal.  Nothing.  The door seemed to absorb
the sound.
He placed his chip against the black plate.
The bolts clicked.
She seemed to hit him, somehow, before he'd actually got-

`Chip,' he said, struggling for breath.  Pain was spreading
from his chest.  She helped him up and shoved him into the
cubicle.
`You bribe the help, upstairs?'
He shook his head and fell across the bed.
`Breathe in.  Count.  One, two, three, four.  Hold it.  Now

`'Cause, if I'd stayed, I might have killed Riviera.'

`I wasn't conscious.  It's like cyberspace, but blank.  Silver.

They switched the software and started renting to specialty

She seemed to speak from a distance.  `And I knew, but I
kept quiet about it.  I needed the money.  The dreams got worse
and worse, and I'd tell myself that at least some of them _were_
just dreams, but by then I'd started to figure that the boss had
a whole little _clientele_ going for me.  Nothing's too good for

`So what was he charging for?'
`Bad dreams.  Real ones.  One night... one night, I'd just
come back from Chiba.'  She dropped the cigarette, ground it
out with her heel, and sat down, leaning against the wall.
`Surgeons went way in, that trip.  Tricky.  They must have

`Senator, he was.  Knew his fat face right away.  We were both
covered with blood.  We weren't alone.  She was all...'  She
tugged at the temperfoam.  `Dead.  And that fat prick, he was
saying, `What's wrong.  What's wrong?'  'Cause we weren't

She began to shake.
`So I guess I gave the Senator what he really wanted, you

her fingers back through her dark hair.  `The house put a con-
tract out on me.  I had to hide for a while.'
Case stared at her.
`So Riviera hit a nerve last night,' she said.  `I guess it
wants me to hate him real bad, so I'll be psyched up to go in
there after him.'
`After him?'
`He's already there.  Straylight.  On the invitation of Lady

Crow: Hey...

Case remembered the face he'd seen.  `You gonna kill him?'
She smiled.  Cold.  `He's going to die, yeah.  Soon.'
`I had a visit too,' he said, and told her about the window,
stumbling over what the Zone-figure had said about Linda.  She
nodded.
`Maybe it wants you to hate something too.'
`Maybe I hate it.'
`Maybe you hate yourself, Case.'


Meacham: Stand back, Exeter!

`How was it?' Bruce asked, as Case climbed into the Honda.

Mike: ...makes no sense.

`Try it sometime,' he said, rubbing his eyes.
`Just can't see you the kinda guy goes for the puppets,'
Cath said unhappily, thumbing a fresh derm against her wrist.
`Can we go home, now?' Bruce asked.
`Sure.  Drop me down Jules Verne, where the bars are.'

Crow: Written? This movie was written? I don't think so.

Crow: Oh.

Rue Jules Verne was a circumferential avenue, looping the
spindle's midpoint, while Desiderata ran its length, terminating
at either end in the supports of the Lado-Acheson light pumps.
If you turned right, off Desiderata, and followed Jules Verne
far enough, you'd find yourself approaching Desiderata from
the left.

Crow: The end? Yes. I mean, no. I wanna change my answer!

Case watched Bruce's trike until it was out of sight, then
turned and walked past a vast, brilliantly lit newsstand, the
covers of dozens of glossy Japanese magazines presenting the
faces of the month's newest simstim stars.
Directly overhead, along the nighted axis, the hologram sky

the grassy tablelands of another casino complex.  Case watched
a drone microlight bank gracefully in an updraft at the green
verge of an artificial mesa, lit for seconds by the soft glow of

the invisible casino.  The thing was a kind of pilotless biplane
of gossamer polymer, its wings silkscreened to resemble a giant
butterfly.  Then it was gone, beyond the mesa's edge.  He'd
seen a wink of reflected neon off glass, either lenses or the
turrets of lasers.  The drones were part of the spindle's security
system, controlled by some central computer.

Crow: Draw... me some butter!

In Straylight?  He walked on, past bars named the Hi-Lo,
the Paradise, le Monde, Cricketeer.  Shozoku Smith's, Emer-
gency.  He chose Emergency because it was the smallest and
most crowded, but it took only seconds for him to realize that
it was a tourist place.  No hum of biz here, only a glazed sexual
tension.  He thought briefly of the nameless club above Molly's
rented cubicle, but the image of her mirrored eyes fixed on the
little screen dissuaded him.  What was Wintermute revealing
there now?  The ground plans of the Villa Straylight?  The history
of the Tessier-Ashpools?
He bought a mug of Carlsberg and found a place against
the wall.  Closing his eyes, he felt for the knot of rage, the pure
small coal of his anger.  It was there still.  Where had it come

maiming in Memphis, nothing at all when he'd killed to defend
his dealing interests in Night City, and a slack sickness and
loathing after Linda's death under the inflated dome.  But no
anger.  Small and far away, on the mind's screen, a semblance

`Thought you went home,' he said, and covered his con-

`I got him to drop me off at this shop.  Bought this.'  She
ran her palm across the fabric, curve of the pelvic girdle.  He
saw the blue derm on her wrist.  `Like it?'
`Sure.'  He automatically scanned the faces around them,

She was quivering, vibrating invisibly with the fresh buzz.
`You get off?'
`Yeah.  But the comedown's a bitch.'

Commander Jansen: Alright.

`Then you need another one.'

Crow: And be sure to make a plate for the narrator.

`And what's that supposed to lead to?'

Mike: Ahhh. 

`I got a key.  Up the hill behind the Paradise, just the cream-
iest crib.  People down the well on business tonight, if you
follow me...'
`If I follow you.'

Crow: Does he got a thing? 

She took his hand between hers, her palms hot and dry.
`You're Yak, aren't you, Lupus?  Gaijin soldierman for the
Yakuza.'
`You got an eye, huh?'  He withdrew his hand and fumbled
for a cigarette.
`How come you got all your fingers, then?  I thought you
had to chop one off every time you screwed up.'
`I never screw up.'  He lit his cigarette.
`I saw that girl you're with.  Day I met you.  Walks like
Hideo.  Scares me.'  She smiled too widely.  `I like that.  She
like it with girls?'
`Never said.  Who's Hideo?'

Crow: Fetch me my warrior muumuu.

`3Jane's, what she calls it, retainer.  Family retainer.'
Case forced himself to stare dully at the Emergency crowd
while he spoke.  `Dee-Jane?'
`Lady 3Jane.  She's triff.  Rich.  Her father owns all this.'

Servo: I fought the loft and the loft won. 

`This bar?'

Crow: Ladies and gentlemen, A Flock of Seagulls. 

`Oh, you know,' she said, lids half lowered in what must
have been intended as a look of modesty, `she likes to party.
Bruce and I, we make the party circuit...  It gets real boring
for her, in there.  Her old man lets her out sometimes, as long
as she brings Hideo to take care of her.'
`Where's it get boring?'
`Straylight, they call it.  She told me, oh, it's pretty, all the
pools and lilies.  It's a castle, a real castle, all stone and sunsets.'
She snuggled in against him.  `Hey, Lupus, man, you need a
derm.  So we can be together.'

Crow: I didn't hear you, ladybritches!

She wore a tiny leather purse on a slender neck-thong.  Her
nails were bright pink against her boosted tan, bitten to the
quick.  She opened the purse and withdrew a paperbacked bub-
ble with a blue derm inside.  Something white tumbled to the

floor; Case stooped and picked it up.  An origami crane.
`Hideo gave it to me,' she said.  `He tried to show me how,
but I can't ever get it right.  The necks come out backwards.'
She tucked the folded paper back into her purse.  Case watched
as she tore the bubble away, peeled the derm from its backing,
and smoothed it across his inner wrist.

Holly: Oh sure, a loner, I got the scene. Just reading the classified ads in the local motel until Dick Powell comes running down the television alley at midnight with a gun in his hand.

`3Jane, she's got a pointy face, nose like a bird?'  He watched
his hands fumble an outline.  `Dark hair?  Young?'
`I guess.  But she's _triff,_ you know?  Like, all that money.'
The drug hit him like an express train, a white-hot column

of light mounting his spine from the region of his prostate,
illuminating the sutures of his skull with x-rays of short-cir-
cuited sexual energy.  His teeth sang in their individual sockets
like tuning forks, each one pitch-perfect and clear as ethanol.
His bones, beneath the hazy envelope of flesh, were chromed
and polished, the joints lubricated with a film of silicone.  Sand-

storms raged across the scoured floor of his skull, generating
waves of high thin static that broke behind his eyes, spheres
of purest crystal, expanding...
`Come on,' she said, taking his hand.  `You got it now.
We got it.  Up the hill, we'll have it all night.'
The anger was expanding, relentless, exponential, riding
out behind the betaphenethylamine rush like a carrier wave, a
seismic fluid, rich and corrosive.  His erection was a bar of
lead.  The faces around them in Emergency were painted doll
things, the pink and white of mouth parts moving, moving,
words emerging like discrete balloons of sound.  He looked at

He dropped her hand and stumbled for the door, shoving
someone out of the way.
`Fuck you!' she screamed behind him, `you ripoff shit!'

Crow: SAT farms of the future! 

He couldn't feel his legs.  He used them like stilts, swaying
crazily across the flagstone pavement of Jules Verne, a distant
rumbling in his ears, his own blood, razored sheets of light
bisecting his skull at a dozen angles.
And then he was frozen, erect, fists tight against his thighs,
head back, his lips curled, shaking.  While he watched the

chrome, stars against night sky.  Face of Miss Linda Lee.
When he was able to look away, to lower his eyes, he found
every other face in the street upraised, the strolling tourists
becalmed with wonder.  And when the lights in the sky went
out, a ragged cheer went up from Jules Verne, to echo off the
terraces and ranked balconies of lunar concrete.

Servo: Yep, That's my cue! Big Alan Steele! Splash me on in the morning, wear the great smell of me all day long!

Somewhere a clock began to chime, some ancient bell out
of Europe.

He walked till morning.
The high wore away, the chromed skeleton corroding hourly,
flesh growing solid, the drug-flesh replaced with the meat of
his life.  He couldn't think.  He liked that very much, to be

conscious and unable to think.  He seemed to become each
thing he saw: a park bench, a cloud of white moths around an
antique streetlight, a robot gardener striped diagonally with
black and yellow.
A recorded dawn crept along the Lado-Acheson system,
pink and lurid.  He forced himself to eat an omelette in a De-
siderata cafe, to drink water, to smoke the last of his cigarettes.
The rooftop meadow of the Intercontinental was stirring as he
crossed it, an early breakfast crowd intent on coffee and crois-
sants beneath the striped umbrellas.

Joe: Of course, I don't know if I'd ever tell my buddies all this. 'Cuz, well, sometimes they laugh when you tell them things like that.

He still had his anger.  That was like being rolled in some
alley and waking to discover your wallet still in your pocket,
untouched.  He warmed himself with it, unable to give it a name

or an object.
He rode the elevator down to his level, fumbling in his
pocket for the Freeside credit chip that served as his key.  Sleep
was becoming real, was something he might do.  To lie down
on the sand-colored temperfoam and find the blankness again.
They were waiting there, the three of them, their perfect
white sportsclothes and stenciled tans setting off the handwoven
organic chic of the furniture.  The girl sat on a wicker sofa, an
automatic pistol beside her on the leaf-patterned print of the
cushion.
`Turing,' she said.  `You are under arrest.'

Mike: I knew I had some rub left...

Crow: Oop! Eh... This must be a massive organization to be able to throw away a $1.50 helicopter. 

`You been here awhile?'  He saw the contents of his bag
spread out across the bed, unwashed clothing sorted by type.
The shuriken lay by itself, between jeans and underwear, on
the sand-tinted temperfoam.
`Where is Kolodny?'  The two men sat side by side on the
couch, their arms crossed over tanned chests, identical gold
chains slung around their necks.  Case peered at them and saw
that their youth was counterfeit, marked by a certain telltale

corrugation at the knuckles, something the surgeons were un-
able to erase.
`Who's Kolodny?'
`That was the name in the register.  Where is she?'
`I dunno,' he said, crossing to the bar and pouring himself
a glass of mineral water.  `She took off.'
`Where did you go tonight, Case?'  The girl picked up the

pistol and rested it on her thigh, without actually pointing it at
him.
`Jules Verne, couple of bars, got high.  How about you?'
His knees felt brittle.  The mineral water was warm and flat.
`I don't think you grasp your situation,' said the man on
the left, taking a pack of Gitanes from the breast pocket of his

`Corto?'
The man's eyes widened.  `Yes.  How do you know that that
is his name?'  A millimeter of flame clicked from the lighter.
`I forget,' Case said.
`You'll remember,' the girl said.

Their names, or worknames, were Michle, Roland, and
Pierre.  Pierre, Case decided, would play the Bad Cop, Roland

them, he was certain, would be kinked for audio, very likely
for simstim, and anything he said or did now was admissible
evidence.  Evidence, he asked himself, through the grinding
come-down, of what?
Knowing that he couldn't follow their French, they spoke
freely among themselves.  Or seemed to.  He caught enough as
it was: names like Pauley, Armitage, Sense/Net, Panther Mod-

French.  But it was entirely possible that the names were there

for his benefit.  They always referred to Molly as Kolodny.
`You say you were hired to make a run, Case,' Roland
said, his slow speech intended to convey reasonableness, `and
that you are unaware of the nature of the target.  Is this not
unusual in your trade?  Having penetrated the defenses, would
you not be unable then to perform the required operation?  And
surely an operation of some kind is required, yes?'  He leaned
forward, elbows on his stenciled brown knees, palms out to

receive Case's explanation.  Pierre paced the room; now he was
by the window, now by the door.  Michle was the kink, Case
decided.  Her eyes never left him.
`Can I put some clothes on?' he asked.  Pierre had insisted

on stripping him, searching the seams of his jeans.  Now he sat
naked on a wicker footstool, with one foot obscenely white.
Roland asked Pierre something in French.  Pierre, at the
window again, was peering through a flat little pair of binoc-
ulars.  _`Non,'_ he said absently, and Roland shrugged, raising
his eyebrows at Case.  Case decided it was a good time to smile.
Roland returned the smile.
Oldest cop bullshit in the book, Case thought.  `Look,' he

said, `I'm sick.  Had this godawful drug in a bar, you know?
I wanna lie down.  You got me already.  You say you got
Armitage.  You got him, go ask _him._  I'm just hired help.'
Roland nodded.  `And Kolodny?'
`She was with Armitage when he hired me.  Just muscle, a
razorgirl.  Far as I know.  Which isn't too far.'

Ken: Yeah, it's one of Dr. Doyle's old patients, Mr. Harvey.

`You know that Armitage's real name is Corto,' Pierre said,
his eyes still hidden by the soft plastic flanges of the binoculars.
`How do you know that, my friend?'

Mike: I wanted nothing more than to throw myself on my hotel bed and cry.

`I guess he mentioned it sometime,' Case said, regretting
the slip.  `Everybody's got a couple names.  Your name Pierre?'
`We know how you were repaired in Chiba,' Michle said,
`and that may have been Wintermute's first mistake.'  Case
stared at her as blankly as he could.  The name hadn't been
mentioned before.  `The process employed on you resulted in
the clinic's owner applying for seven basic patents.  Do you
know what that means?'
`No.'
`It means that the operator of a black clinic in Chiba City
now owns a controlling interest in three major medical research
consortiums.  This reverses the usual order of things, you see.

Case wondered how old she might be.  People said that age

They ran an inventory for us.  They discovered that McCoy

`In Istanbul,' Roland said, almost apologetically, `it was
very easy.  The woman had alienated Armitage's contact with

the secret police.'
`And then you came here,' Pierre said, slipping the bin-
oculars into his shorts pocket.  `We were delighted.'
`Chance to work on your tan?'

Narrator: The children of the USA.

`You know what we mean,' Michle said.  `If you wish to
pretend that you do not, you only make things more difficult
for yourself.  There is still the matter of extradition.  You will
return with us, Case, as will Armitage.  But where, exactly,
will we all be going?  To Switzerland, where you will be merely
a pawn in the trial of an artificial intelligence?  Or to le BAMA,
where you can be proven to have participated not only in data
invasion and larceny, but in an act of public mischief which
cost fourteen innocent lives?  The choice is yours.'
Case took a Yeheyuan from his pack; Pierre lit it for him
with the gold Dunhill.  `Would Armitage protect you?'  The

question was punctuated by the lighter's bright jaws snapping
shut.
Case looked up at him through the ache and bitterness of

is over and you are in the way.'
`One thing,' Case said, and drew on his cigarette.  He blew
the smoke up at the Turing Registry agent.  `Do you guys have
any real jurisdiction out here?  I mean, shouldn't you have the
Freeside security team in on this party?  It's their turf, isn't it?'
He saw the dark eyes harden in the lean boy face and tensed
for the blow, but Pierre only shrugged.
`It doesn't matter,' Roland said.  `You will come with us.

Exeter: Stand back. I command you, STAND BACK!

We are at home with situations of legal ambiguity.  The treaties
under which our arm of the Registry operates grant us a great
deal of flexibility.  And we _create_ flexibility, in situations where
it is required.'  The mask of amiability was down, suddenly,
Roland's eyes as hard as Pierre's.
`You are worse than a fool,' Michle said, getting to her
feet, the pistol in her hand.  `You have no care for your species.

Sue: ...and have the same feelings about... religion in general?

For thousands of years men dreamed of pacts with demons.

paid with?  What would your price be, for aiding this thing to
free itself and grow?'  There was a knowing weariness in her
young voice that no nineteen-year-old could have mustered.
`You will dress now.  You will come with us.  Along with the
one you call Armitage, you will return with us to Geneva and
give testimony in the trial of this intelligence.  Otherwise, we
kill you.  Now.'  She raised the pistol, a smooth black Walther
with an integral silencer.
`I'm dressing already,' he said, stumbling toward the bed.
His legs were still numb, clumsy.  He fumbled with a clean
t-shirt.
`We have a ship standing by.  We will erase Pauley's con-
struct with a pulse weapon.'
`Sense/Net'll be pissed,' Case said, thinking: and all the
evidence in the Hosaka.
`They are in some difficulty already, for having owned such
a thing.'
Case pulled the shirt over his head.  He saw the shuriken on
the bed, lifeless metal, his star.  He felt for the anger.  It was
gone.  Time to give in, to roll with it...  He thought of the
toxin sacs.  `Here comes the meat,' he muttered.
In the elevator to the meadow, he thought of Molly.  She
might already be in Straylight.  Hunting Riviera.  Hunted, prob-
ably, by Hideo, who was almost certainly the ninja clone of
the Finn's story, the one who'd come to retrieve the talking
head.
He rested his forehead against the matte black plastic of a
wall panel and closed his eyes.  His limbs were wood, old,

warped and heavy with rain.
Lunch was being served beneath the trees, under the bright
umbrellas.  Roland and Michle fell into character, chattering
brightly in French.  Pierre came behind.  Michle kept the muz-
zle of her pistol close to his ribs, concealing the gun with a
white duck jacket she draped over her arm.
Crossing the meadow, weaving between the tables and the

Black fur boiled at the borders of his vision.  He glanced up at
the hot white band of the Lado-Acheson armature and saw a
giant butterfly banking gracefully against recorded sky.
At the edge of the meadow they came to railinged cliffside,

wild flowers dancing in the updraft from the canyon that was
Desiderata.  Michle tossed her short dark hair and pointed,
saying something in French to Roland.  She sounded genuinely
happy.  Case followed the direction of her gesture and saw the
curve of planing lakes, the white glint of casinos, turquoise
rectangles of a thousand pools, the bodies of bathers, tiny bronze
hieroglyphs, all held in serene approximation of gravity against
the endless curve of Freeside's hull.
They followed the railing to an ornate iron bridge that arched
over Desiderata.  Michle prodded him with the muzzle of the
Walther.

someone tripped him.  He rolled, seeing Michle on her back,
knees up, aiming the Walther with both hands.  _That's a waste
of effort,_ he thought, with the strange lucidity of shock.  She
was trying to shoot down the microlight.

per hour.  Case kept his eyes closed.  The shower had helped,
but he'd lost his breakfast when he'd looked down and seen
Pierre's blood washing pink across the white tiles.
Gravity fell away as the spindle narrowed.  Case's stomach
churned.
Aerol was waiting with his scooter beside the dock.
`Case, mon, big problem.'  The soft voice faint in his phones.
He chinned the volume control and peered into the Lexan
face-plate of Aerol's helmet.
`Gotta get to _Garvey,_ Aerol.'
`Yo.  Strap in, mon.  But _Garvey_ captive.  Yacht, came be-

Crow: Fonzie's death car.

frame and began to fasten the straps.
`Japan yacht.  Brought you package...'

Retik: Not at all. They are merely softening up your defenses for our impending invasion.

Armitage.

Confused images of wasps and spiders rose in Case's mind
as they came in sight of _Marcus Garvey._  The little tug was
snug against the gray thorax of a sleek, insectile ship five times
her length.  The arms of grapples stood out against _Garvey_'s
patched hull with the strange clarity of vacuum and raw sun-
light.  A pale corrugated gangway curved out of the yacht,
snaked sideways to avoid the tug's engines, and covered the
aft hatch.  There was something obscene about the arrangement,

Crow: This movie seems kind of familiar, doesn't it?

but it had more to do with ideas of feeding than of sex.
`What's happening with Maelcum?'

Crow: Well, it shouldn't drink so much coffee! 

`Maelcum fine.  Nobody come down the tube.  Yacht pilot
talk to him, say relax.'
As they swung past the gray ship, Case saw the name HAN-
IWA in crisp white capitals beneath an oblong cluster of Jap-
anese.
`I don't like this, man.  I was thinking maybe it's time we
got our ass out of here anyway.'

Crow: Yes! It's the same thing you've seen before! Only it's...happening again! 

`Maelcum thinkin'~ that precise thing, mon, but _Garvey_ not
be goin'~ far like that.'

Maelcum was purring a speeded-up patois to his radio when
Case came through the forward lock and removed his helmet.
`Aerol's gone back to the _Rocker,'_ Case said.
Maelcum nodded, still whispering to the microphone.
Case pulled himself over the pilot's drifting tangle of dread-
locks and began to remove his suit.  Maelcum's eyes were
closed now; he nodded as he listened to some reply over a pair
of phones with bright orange pads, his brow creased with con-

`So who's up there in that thing?'

Baydool: These will put anyone to sleep in no time.

`Same Japan-boy came before.  An'~ now he joined by you

Case put the trodes on and jacked in.

The matrix showed him the pink spheres of the steel combine

`Yeah, but Wintermute killed 'em.'

Case punched for the Freeside coordinates.
`Lemme take that a sec, Case...'  The matrix blurred and
phased as the Flatline executed an intricate series of jumps with
a speed and accuracy that made Case wince with envy.
`Shit, Dixie...'

Jody: Oh, does your father mind if people skip rocks across his pond?

`This isn't looking so hot, is it?  I mean, the Turings are on

Crow: Say, Mike—was there a Hitler Building where you grew up?

`Yeah?  No shit?  You don't wanna see what that Chinese
program can do?'
`Well, I...'  Case stared at the green walls of the T-A ice.
`Well, screw it.  Yeah.  We run.'

Servo: Woah, seen him in my nightmares... 

`Slot it.'
`Hey, Maelcum,' Case said, jacking out, `I'm probably
gonna be under the trodes for maybe eight hours straight.'

Crow: Yeah, that's why I'm leavin'. 

Maelcum was smoking again.  The cabin was swimming in

`No problem, mon.'  The Zionite executed a high forward
somersault and rummaged through the contents of a zippered
mesh bag, coming up with a coil of transparent tubing and
something else, something sealed in a sterile bubble pack.

Ann: DRIIIIIIIIVE!

He called it a Texas catheter, and Case didn't like it at all.
He slotted the Chinese virus, paused, then drove it home.

Mike: There! I think I've taught you not to rebuff my wiener innuendo! 

`Okay,' he said, `we're on.  Listen, Maelcum, if it gets

Crow: You know, this makes me want to heat up a Libbyland frozen dinner and eat in front of the TV!

`Sure, mon.'  Maelcum lit a fresh joint.
`And turn the scrubber up.  I don't want that shit tangling
with my neurotransmitters.  I got a bad hangover as it is.'
Maelcum grinned.
Case jacked back in.
`Christ on a crutch,' the Flatline said, `take a look at this.'
The Chinese virus was unfolding around them.  Polychrome
shadow, countless translucent layers shifting and recombining.
Protean, enormous, it towered above them, blotting out the
void.
`Big mother,' the Flatline said.

Servo: Oh, so he learns he enjoys violence, and he's ready to kill like a man oughta. 

`I'm gonna check Molly,' Case said, tapping the simstim

Freefall.  The sensation was like diving through perfectly
clear water.  She was falling-rising through a wide tube of fluted
lunar concrete, lit at two-meter intervals by rings of white neon.
The link was one way.  He couldn't talk to her.
He flipped.

We're not there.'
Case searched the matrix around the Tessier-Ashpool ice

until he found the pink structure, a standard commercial unit,
and punched in closer to it.  `Maybe it's defective.'
`Maybe, but I doubt it.  Our baby's military, though.  And

of Chinese sneak attack, but nobody's twigged to us at all.
Maybe not even the folks in Straylight.'
Case watched the blank wall that screened Straylight.  `Well,'
he said, `that's an advantage, right?'
`Maybe.'  The construct approximated laughter.  Case winced

`Too bad,' the Flatline said.  `Ol'~ dead man needs his laughs.'
Case slapped the simstim switch.

And crashed through tangled metal and the smell of dust,
the heels of his hands skidding as they struck slick paper.
Something behind him collapsed noisily.
`C'mon,' said the Finn, `ease up a little.'
Case lay sprawled across a pile of yellowing magazines,
the girls shining up at him in the dimness of Metro Holografix,

Crow: Hmm... the camera operator is indulging himself here... 

a wistful galaxy of sweet white teeth.  He lay there until his
heart had slowed, breathing the smell of old magazines.
`Wintermute,' he said.
`Yeah,' said the Finn, somewhere behind him, `you got
it.'

Holly: Oh sure, a loner, I got the scene. Just reading the classified ads in the local motel until Dick Powell comes running down the television alley at midnight with a gun in his hand.

`Fuck off.'  Case sat up, rubbing his wrists.

Mike: Mmm… mmm… oh, you smell like a tire store.

`Come _on,'_ said the Finn, stepping out of a sort of alcove
in the wall of junk.  `This way's better for you, man.'  He took
his Partagas from a coat pocket and lit one.  The smell of Cuban

Tommy: Hi, Roxie!

tobacco filled the shop.  `You want I should come to you in
the matrix like a burning bush?  You aren't missing anything,
back there.  An hour here'll only take you a couple of seconds.'
`You ever think maybe it gets on my nerves, you coming
on like people I know?'  He stood, swatting pale dust from the
front of his black jeans.  He turned, glaring back at the dusty
shop windows, the closed door to the street.  `What's out there?
New York?  Or does it just stop?'
`Well,' said the Finn, `it's like that tree, you know?  Falls
in the woods but maybe there's nobody to hear it.'  He showed
Case his huge front teeth, and puffed his cigarette.  `You can

parts of it you ever saw.  This is memory, right?  I tap you, sort
it out, and feed it back in.'
`I don't have this good a memory,' Case said, looking
around.  He looked down at his hands, turning them over.  He
tried to remember what the lines on his palms were like, but
couldn't.
`Everybody does,' the Finn said, dropping his cigarette and
grinding it out under his heel, `but not many of you can access
it.  Artists can, mostly, if they're any good.  If you could lay
this construct over the reality, the Finn's place in lower Man-
hattan, you'd see a difference, but maybe not as much as you'd
think.  Memory's holographic, for you.'  The Finn tugged at
one of his small ears.  `I'm different.'
`How do you mean, holographic?'  The word made him
think of Riviera.
`The holographic paradigm is the closest thing you've worked
out to a representation of human memory, is all.  But you've
never done anything about it.  People, I mean.'  The Finn stepped
forward and canted his streamlined skull to peer up at Case.
`Maybe if you had, I wouldn't be happening.'

Mike: Wait a minute! Men and women breeding better poultry? What kind of sick experiment is this?

`What's that supposed to mean?'
The Finn shrugged.  His tattered tweed was too wide across

the shoulders, and didn't quite settle back into position.  `I'm
trying to help you, Case.'
`Why?'
`Because I need you.'  The large yellow teeth appeared
again.  `And because you need me.'
`Bullshit.  Can you read my mind, Finn?'  He grimaced.

Mike: Why, here's something else Satan created: Japanimation!

`Wintermute, I mean.'
`Minds aren't _read._  See, you've still got the paradigms
print gave you, and you're barely print-literate.  I can _access_
your memory, but that's not the same as your mind.'  He
reached into the exposed chassis of an ancient television and
withdrew a silver-black vacuum tube.  `See this?  Part of my
DNA, sort of...'  He tossed the thing into the shadows and

Servo: I'll just move this high-voltage power line with, uh, this piece of metal. Let me dip it in water first. 

Case heard it pop and tinkle.  `You're always building models.

Joel: Is this an infomercial? Where's Cher?

`I don't know what you're talking about.'
`That's `you' in the collective.  Your species.'
`You killed those Turings.'
The Finn shrugged.  `Hadda.  Hadda.  You should give a shit;

right hand held the charred wasps'~ nest from Case's dream,
reek of fuel in the closeness of the dark shop.  Case stumbled
back against a wall of junk.  `Yeah.  That was me.  Did it with

the holo rig in the window.  Another memory I tapped out of
you when I flatlined you that first time.  Know why it's im-

Case shook his head.

Crow: NUTCASE NATALIE'S HERE! 

`Because' -- and the nest, somehow, was gone -- `it's the
closest thing you got to what Tessier-Ashpool would like to
be.  The human equivalent.  Straylight's like that nest, or anyway
it was supposed to work out that way.  I figure it'll make you
feel better.'
`Feel better?'

Woman: I want a Pontiac, too!

`To know what they're like.  You were starting to hate my
guts for a while there.  That's good.  But hate them instead.
Same difference.'
`Listen,' Case said, stepping forward, `they never did shit
to me.  You, it's different...'  But he couldn't feel the anger.
`So T-A, they made me.  The French girl, she said you were
selling out the species.  Demon, she said I was.'  The Finn
grinned.  `It doesn't much matter.  You gotta hate somebody
before this is over.'  He turned and headed for the back of the
shop.  `Well, come on, I'll show you a little bit of Straylight
while I got you here.'  He lifted the corner of the blanket.  White
light poured out.  `Shit, man, don't just stand there.'
Case followed, rubbing his face.
`Okay,' said the Finn, and grabbed his elbow.

Mike: Ohh. Damn you, Servo! 

They were drawn past the stale wool in a puff of dust, into
freefall and a cylindrical corridor of fluted lunar concrete, ringed
with white neon at two-meter intervals.
`Jesus,' Case said, tumbling.
`This is the front entrance,' the Finn said, his tweed flap-
ping.  `If this weren't a construct of mine, where the shop is

Case managed to straighten out, but began to corkscrew in

a long spiral.
`Hold on,' the Finn said, `I'll fast-forward us.'
The walls blurred.  Dizzying sensation of headlong move-
ment, colors, whipping around corners and through narrow
corridors.  They seemed at one point to pass through several
meters of solid wall, a flash of pitch darkness.
`Here,' the Finn said.  `This is it.'
They floated in the center of a perfectly square room, walls
and ceiling paneled in rectangular sections of dark wood.  The
floor was covered by a single square of brilliant carpet patterned
after a microchip, circuits traced in blue and scarlet wool.  In

Joel: His story has a better plot than this movie... 

`The Villa Straylight,' said a jeweled thing on the pedestal,
in a voice like music, `is a body grown in upon itself, a Gothic
folly.  Each space in Straylight is in some way secret, this
endless series of chambers linked by passages, by stairwells
vaulted like intestines, where the eye is trapped in narrow
curves, carried past ornate screens, empty alcoves...'
`Essay of 3Jane's,' the Finn said, producing his Partagas.

Rocky: Easy.

`Wrote that when she was twelve.  Semiotics course.'
`The architects of Freeside went to great pains to conceal
the fact that the interior of the spindle is arranged with the
banal precision of furniture in a hotel room.  In Straylight, the
hull's inner surface is overgrown with a desperate proliferation
of structures, forms flowing, interlocking, rising toward a solid
core of microcircuitry, our clan's corporate heart, a cylinder
of silicon wormholed with narrow maintenance tunnels, some
no wider than a man's hand.  The bright crabs burrow there,
the drones, alert for micromechanical decay or sabotage.'
`That was her you saw in the restaurant,' the Finn said.
`By the standards of the archipelago,' the head continued,

Crow: Thank you, I love cake! 

`ours is an old family, the convolutions of our home reflecting

that age.  But reflecting something else as well.  The semiotics
of the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of the bright void
beyond the hull.
`~Tessier and Ashpool climbed the well of gravity to discover
that they loathed space.  They built Freeside to tap the wealth
of the new islands, grew rich and eccentric, and began the

with lapis and pearl.  The bright marbles of its eyes were cut

first Tessier up the well, and returned for the first Ashpool...'
The head fell silent.

answer him.

`What happens then?'

Servo: No, wait. Did this movie just lap itself?

`I don't exist, after that.  I cease.'
`Okay by me,' Case said.
`Sure.  But you watch your ass, Case.  My, ah, other lobe
is on to us, it looks like.  One burning bush looks pretty much
like another.  And Armitage is starting to go.'
`What's that mean?'
But the paneled room folded itself through a dozen impos-
sible angles, tumbling away into cyberspace like an origami
crane.

`You tryin'~ to break my record, son?' the Flatline asked.

She pressed her tongue hard against her lower front teeth.
One moved slightly, activating her microchannel amps; the
random bounce of photons through the darkness was converted
to a pulse of electrons, the concrete around her coming up
ghost-pale and grainy.  `Okay, honey.  Now we go out to play.'

The low, vaulted hallway was lined with dozens of museum
cases, archaic-looking glass-fronted boxes made of brown wood.
They looked awkward there, against the organic curves of the
hallway's walls, as though they'd been brought in and set up
in a line for some forgotten purpose.  Dull brass fixtures held
globes of white light at ten-meter intervals.  The floor was
uneven, and as she set off along the corridor, Case realized
that hundreds of small rugs and carpets had been put down at
random.  In some places, they were six deep, the floor a soft
patchwork of handwoven wool.
Molly paid little attention to the cabinets and their contents,
which irritated him.  He had to satisfy himself with her disin-
terested glances, which gave him fragments of pottery antique
weapons, a thing so densely studded with rusted nails that it
was unrecognizable, frayed sections of tapestry.

Old man takes a step.  Rat moves.  Rat moves, he takes another

Servo: GIVE IT TO ME! GIMME!

Points it at the floor, grins, and pulls the trigger.  Rolled it back
up and left.
`~I crawled under there later.  Rat had a hole between its
eyes.'  She was watching the sealed doorways that opened at
intervals along the corridor.  `The second one, the one who

was like that.  He killed that way.'  The corridor widened.  The
sea of rich carpets undulated gently beneath an enormous can-
delabrum whose lowest crystal pendant reached nearly to the
floor.  Crystal tinkled as Molly entered the hall.  THIRD DOOR

The door in front of her was old, a carved slab of Thai teak
that seemed to have been sawn in half to fit the low doorway.
A primitive mechanical lock with a stainless face had been
inset beneath a swirling dragon.  She knelt, drew a tight little
roll of black chamois from an inside pocket, and selected a

in the cubicle, she'd seldom said anything that had even in-
dicated that she had a past.
She closed her eyes and there was a click that Case felt
rather than heard.  It made him remember the magnetic locks
on the door of her cubicle in the puppet place.  The door had
opened for him, even though he'd had the wrong chip.  That

was Wintermute, manipulating the lock the way it had manip-
ulated the drone micro and the robot gardener.  The lock system
in the puppet place had been a subunit of Freeside's security
system.  The simple mechanical lock here would pose a real
problem for the AI, requiring either a drone of some kind or
a human agent.
She opened her eyes, put the pick back into the chamois,
carefully rerolled it, and tucked it back into its pocket.  `Guess
you're kinda like he was,' she said.  `Think you're born to run.
Figure what you were into back in Chiba, that was a stripped
down version of what you'd be doing anywhere.  Bad luck, it'll
do that sometimes, get you down to basics.'  She stood, stretched,
shook herself.  `You know, I figure the one Tessier-Ashpool
sent after that Jimmy, the boy who stole the head, he must be
pretty much the same as the one the Yak sent to kill Johnny.'
She drew the fletcher from its holster and dialed the barrel to
full auto.
The ugliness of the door struck Case as she reached for it.

Crow: You will bow down before me, Jet Jaguar!

Not the door itself, which was beautiful, or had once been part
of some more beautiful whole, but the way it had been sawn
down to fit a particular entrance.  Even the shape was wrong,

Molly grasped one of the carved dragon's forelegs and the
door swung open easily.

first.  It was no more than a shallow tray.  Empty.  The second

Crow: I'm being turned on by a woman who is long dead! 

In the fifth, behind the armored gauntlet of a heavy vacuum
suit, she found the key.  It was like a dull brass coin with a
short hollow tube braised against one edge.  She turned it slowly
in her hand and Case saw that the interior of the tube was lined
with studs and flanges.  The letters CHUBB were molded across
one face of the coin.  The other was blank.
`He told me,' she whispered.  `Wintermute.  How he played
a waiting game for years.  Didn't have any real power, then,
but he could use the Villa's security and custodial systems to
keep track of where everything was, how things moved, where
they went.  He saw somebody lose this key twenty years ago,
and he managed to get somebody else to leave it here.  Then
he killed him, the boy who'd brought it here.  Kid was eight.'
She closed her white fingers over the key.  `So nobody would

`He said if they'd turned into what they'd wanted to, he
could've gotten out a long time ago.  But they didn't.  Screwed
up.  Freaks like 3Jane.  That's what he called her, but he talked

She turned, opened the door, and stepped out, her hand
brushing the checkered grip of the holstered fletcher.
Case flipped.

Kuang Grade Mark Eleven was growing.
`Dixie, you think this thing'll work?'
`Does a bear shit in the woods?'  The Flatline punched them
up through shifting rainbow strata.
Something dark was forming at the core of the Chinese
program.  The density of information overwhelmed the fabric
of the matrix, triggering hypnagogic images.  Faint kaleidoscop-
ic angles centered in to a silver-black focal point.  Case watched
childhood symbols of evil and bad luck tumble out along trans-
lucent planes: swastikas, skulls and crossbones, dice flashing
snake eyes.  If he looked directly at that null point, no outline
would form.  It took a dozen quick, peripheral takes before he

`Only game in town, it looks like.'
`Jah love, Case,' Maelcum said, and turned back to his

of muscle around the man's dark arms.
He jacked back in.
And flipped.


Servo: I'm a respected neurosurgeon! 

Molly was trotting along a length of corridor that might
have been the one she'd traveled before.  The glass-fronted cases
were gone now, and Case decided they were moving toward
the tip of the spindle; gravity was growing weaker.  Soon she
was bounding smoothly over rolling hillocks of carpets.  Faint

twinges in her leg...
The corridor narrowed suddenly, curved split.
She turned right and started up a freakishly steep flight of
stairs, her leg beginning to ache.  Overhead, strapped and bun-

of the passage came a voice, loud and slurred, like the voice
of a drunk.  Case thought the language might be French, but it
was too indistinct.  Molly took a step, another, her hand sliding
into the suit to touch the butt of her fletcher.  When she stepped
into the neural disruptor's field, her ears rang, a tiny rising
tone that made Case think of the sound of her fletcher.  She

She got up slowly, her eyes fixed on the muzzle of a black

gun's barrel seemed to be attached to her throat with a taut,
invisible string.
He was old, very tall, and his features reminded Case of
the girl he had glimpsed in the Vingtime Sicle.  He wore a
heavy robe of maroon silk, quilted around the long cuffs and
shawl collar.  One foot was bare, the other in a black velvet
slipper with an embroidered gold foxhead over the instep.  He
motioned her into the room.  `Slow, darling.'  The room was
very large, cluttered with an assortment of things that made no
sense to Case.  He saw a gray steel rack of old-fashioned Sony
monitors, a wide brass bed heaped with sheepskins, with pil-

lows that seemed to have been made from the kind of rug used
to pave the corridors.  Molly's eyes darted from a huge Tele-
funken entertainment console to shelves of antique disk re-
cordings, their crumbling spines cased in clear plastic, to a
wide worktable littered with slabs of silicon.  Case registered

the cyberspace deck and the trodes, but her glance slid over it
without pausing.
`It would be customary,' the old man said, `for me to kill
you now.'  Case felt her tense, ready for a move.  `But tonight
I indulge myself.  What is your name?'

Bob Draper: Hi, I'm Bob Draper. School must've assigned you a keeper.

`Molly.'
`Molly.  Mine is Ashpool.'  He sank back into the creased
softness of a huge leather armchair with square chrome legs,
but the gun never wavered.  He put her fletcher on a brass table
beside the chair, knocking over a plastic vial of red pills.  The
table was thick with vials, bottles of liquor, soft plastic en-
velopes spilling white powders.  Case noticed an old-fashioned
glass hypodermic and a plain steel spoon.
`How do you cry, Molly?  I see your eyes are walled away.
I'm curious.'  His eyes were red-rimmed, his forehead gleaming
with sweat.  He was very pale.  Sick, Case decided.  Or drugs.
`I don't cry, much.'

Servo: Hey, rats. That was my van! 

`But how would you cry, if someone made you cry?'
`I spit,' she said.  `The ducts are routed back into my mouth.'
`Then you've already learned an important lesson, for one
so young.'  He rested the hand with the pistol on his knee and
took a bottle from the table beside him, without bothering to
choose from the half-dozen different liquors.  He drank.  Brandy.
A trickle of the stuff ran from the corner of his mouth.  `That
is the way to handle tears.'  He drank again.  `I'm busy tonight,
Molly.  I built all this, and now I'm busy.  Dying.'

Crow: These things make everything look bigger! 

`I could go out the way I came,' she said.

Narrator: Brother notices the time, and realizes that he must put things in order, and clean himself up in time for dinner.

He laughed, a harsh high sound.  `You intrude on my suicide
and then ask to simply walk out?  Really, you amaze me.  A
thief.'
`It's my ass, boss, and it's all I got.  I just wanna get it out
of here in one piece.'
`You are a very rude girl.  Suicides here are conducted with

a degree of decorum.  That's what I'm doing, you understand.
But perhaps I'll take you with me tonight, down to hell...  It
would be very Egyptian of me.'  He drank again.  `Come here
then.'  He held out the bottle, his hand shaking.  `Drink.'
She shook her head.
`It isn't poisoned,' he said, but returned the brandy to the
table.  `Sit.  Sit on the floor.  We'll talk.'

Mike: The rats put in a new crystal!

`What about?'  She sat.  Case felt the blades move, very
slightly, beneath her nails.

tinged with blue.  His head sank back into the waiting leather
and he began to snore.
Up, she snatched the gun.  She stalked the room, Ashpool's
automatic in her hand.
A vast quilt or comforter was heaped beside the bed, in a
broad puddle of congealed blood, thick and shiny on the pat-
terned rugs.  Twitching a corner of the quilt back, she found
the body of a girl, white shoulder blades slick with blood.  Her
throat had been slit.  The triangular blade of some sort of scraper
glinted in the dark pool beside her.  Molly knelt, careful to
avoid the blood, and turned the dead girl's face to the light.
The face Case had seen in the restaurant.
There was a click, deep at the very center of things, and
the world was frozen.  Molly's simstim broadcast had become
a still frame, her fingers on the girl's cheek.  The freeze held
for three seconds, and then the dead face was altered, became
the face of Linda Lee.
Another click, and the room blurred.  Molly was standing,
looking down at a golden laser disk beside a small console on
the marble top of a bedside table.  A length of fiberoptic ribbon
ran like a leash from the console to a socket at the base of the
slender neck.
`I got your number, fucker,' Case said, feeling his own lips
moving, somewhere, far away.  He knew that Wintermute had
altered the broadcast.  Molly hadn't seen the dead girl's face

Servo: Really dumb scene… end! 

swirl like smoke, to take on the outline of Linda's deathmask.
Molly turned.  She crossed the room to Ashpool's chair.  The
man's breathing was slow and ragged.  She peered at the litter
of drugs and alcohol.  She put his pistol down, picked up her
fletcher, dialed the barrel over to single shot, and very carefully
put a toxin dart through the center of his closed left eyelid.  He
jerked once, breath halting in mid-intake.  His other eye, brown

and fathomless, opened slowly.
It was still open when she turned and left the room.

`Got your boss on hold,' the Flatline said.  `He's coming
through on the twin Hosaka in that boat upstairs, the one that's
riding us piggy-back.  Called the _Haniwa.'_
`I know,' Case said, absently, `I saw it.'
A lozenge of white light clicked into place in front of him,
hiding the Tessier-Ashpool ice; it showed him the calm, per-
fectly focused, utterly crazy face of Armitage, his eyes blank
as buttons.  Armitage blinked.  Stared.
`Guess Wintermute took care of your Turings too, huh?

Crow: Tscha!

Like he took care of mine,' Case said.
Armitage stared.  Case resisted the sudden urge to look away,
drop his gaze.  `You okay, Armitage?'

Crow: "Coming up on your mudflaps." People have such cute names for sex.

`General who?'
The lozenge went blank.

the construct.

Servo: Well, we learned that lights and lighting really aren't necessary to make a film these days.

Something came ticking quietly out of the shadows, on a
level with her left shoulder.  It paused, swayed its spherical body
from side to side on high-arched spider legs, fired a micro-
second burst of diffuse laserlight, and froze.  It was a Braun
microdrone, and Case had once owned the same model, a
pointless accessory he'd obtained as part of a package deal with
a Cleveland hardware fence.  It looked like a stylized matte
black daddy longlegs.  A red LED began to pulse, at the sphere's
equator.  Its body was no larger than a baseball.  `Okay,' she
said, `I hear you.'  She stood up, favoring her left leg, and
watched the little drone reverse.  It picked its methodical way

Then she was off after the Braun, threading her way between

quickly, and she gritted her teeth at the stabbing pain in her
leg as she began to climb.  The ladder continued up through a
metal tube, barely wide enough for her shoulders.
She was climbing up out of gravity, toward the weightless
axis.
Her chip pulsed the time.

Case glanced over his shoulder: his rented suit swung against
the hammock where he'd snapped it, swaying in the air current
from the old Russian scrubber.  He closed his eyes.  He saw the
sacs of toxin dissolving in his arteries.  He saw Molly hauling
herself up the endless steel rungs.  He opened his eyes.
`I dunno, man,' he said, a strange taste in his mouth.  He
looked down at his desk, at his hands.  `I don't know.'  He
looked back up.  The brown face was calm now, intent.  Mael-

Maelcum nodded, the dreadbag bobbing behind him like a
captive balloon of crocheted cotton.  `She you woman, Case?'
`I dunno.  Nobody's woman, maybe.'  He shrugged.  And
found his anger again, real as a shard of hot rock beneath his
ribs.  `Fuck this,' he said.  `Fuck Armitage, fuck Wintermute,
and fuck you.  I'm stayin'~ right here.'
Maelcum's smile spread across his face like light breaking.
`Maelcum a rude boy, Case.  _Garvey_ Maelcum boat.'  His gloved
hand slapped a panel and the bass-heavy rocksteady of Zion
dub came pulsing from the tug's speakers.  `Maelcum not run-

A white lozenge snapped into position, filled with a close-

was using the _Haniwa_'s navigation deck to link with the Hosaka
in _Marcus Garvey._
`Case, I need the damage reports on Omaha Thunder.'
`Say.  I...  Colonel?'
`Hang in there, boy.  Remember your training.'

Servo: Attaining.... maximum RPM.... adjust pitch and yaw thrusters..... stabilize! There, that ought to—AAAAAAAAAAH!!!

_But where have you been, man?_ he silently asked the an-
guished eyes.  Wintermute had built something called Armitage
into a catatonic fortress named Corto.  Had convinced Corto
that Armitage was the real thing, and Armitage had walked,
talked, schemed, bartered data for capital, fronted for Win-
termute in that room in the Chiba Hilton...  And now Arm-
itage was gone, blown away by the winds of Corto's madness.
But where had Corto _been,_ those years?
Falling, burned and blinded, out of a Siberian sky.
`Case, this will be difficult for you to accept, I know that.
You're an officer.  The training.  I understand.  But, Case, as
God is my witness, we have been betrayed.'
Tears started from the blue eyes.
`Colonel, ah, who?  Who's betrayed us?'
`General Girling, Case.  You may know him by a code name.
You do know the man of whom I speak.'

Crow: Well, we'd better camp here tonight. The next stock footage is 18 miles away. 

`Yeah,' Case said, as the tears continued to flow, `I guess
I do.  Sir,' he added, on impulse.  `But, sir, Colonel, what
exactly should we do?  Now, I mean.'
`Our duty at this point, Case, lies in flight.  Escape.  Evasion.

`The midbay lock,' the Flatline said.
`Open the midbay lock.  Just tell your central console there
to open it, right?  We'll be up there with you fast, Colonel.
Then we can talk about getting out of here.'
The lozenge vanished.
`Boy, I think you just lost me, there,' the Flatline said.
`The toxins,' Case said, `the fucking toxins,' and jacked
out.

how to work the seals.

`Got a medical kit, ya know.'
`Maelcum, Christ, help me with this goddam suit.'
The Zionite kicked off from the pink pilot module.  `Easy,
mon.  Measure twice, cut once, wise man put it.  We get up
there...'

There was air in the corrugated gangway that led from _Mar-
cus Garvey_'s aft lock to the midbay lock of the yacht called

the passage with balletic grace, only pausing to help Case,

_Garvey._  The white plastic sides of the tube filtered the raw
sunlight; there were no shadows.
_Garvey_'s airlock hatch was patched and pitted, decorated
with a laser-carved Lion of Zion.  _Haniwa_'s midbay hatch was
creamy gray, blank and pristine.  Maelcum inserted his gloved
hand in a narrow recess.  Case saw his fingers move.  Red LEDs
came to life in the recess, counting down from fifty.  Maelcum
withdrew his hand.  Case, with one glove braced against the
hatch, felt the vibration of the lock mechanism through his suit
and bones.  The round segment of gray hull began to withdraw
into the side of _Haniwa._  Maelcum grabbed the recess with one
hand and Case with the other.  The lock took them with it.

_Haniwa_ was a product of the Dornier-Fujitsu yards, her
interior informed by a design philosophy similar to the one that
had produced the Mercedes that had chauffeured them through
Istanbul.  The narrow midbay was walled in imitation ebony
veneer and floored with gray Italian tiles.  Case felt as though
he were invading some rich man's private spa by way of the

shower.  The yacht, which had been assembled in orbit, had
never been intended for re-entry.  Her smooth, wasplike line
was simply styling, and everything about her interior was cal-
culated to add to the overall impression of speed.
When Maelcum removed his battered helmet, Case followed
his lead.  They hung there in the lock, breathing air that smelled
faintly of pine.  Under it, a disturbing edge of burning insula-
tion.
Maelcum sniffed.  `Trouble here, mon.  Any boat, you smell
that...'
A door, padded with dark gray ultrasuede, slid smoothly
back into its housing.  Maelcum kicked off the ebony wall and
sailed neatly through the narrow opening, twisting his broad

walled corridor, `be there.'  He launched himself with another
effortless kick.  From somewhere ahead, Case made out the
familiar chatter of a printer turning out hard copy.  It grew
louder as he followed Maelcum through another doorway, into
a swirling mass of tangled printout.  Case snatched a length of
twisted paper and glanced at it.

Crow: Believe me, Mike, I calculated the odds of this succeeding against the odds I was doing something incredibly stupid… and I went ahead anyway.

`No,' Case said, grabbing for his drifting helmet, `the Flat-

`Smell like he wipe 'em wi'~ laser, ya know?'  The Zionite
braced his foot against the white cage of a Swiss exercise

it away from his face.

of the narrow articulated chair with a length of some sort of

his larynx.  A single sphere of dark blood had congealed there
like some strange precious stone, a red-black pearl.  Case saw

shredding and crumpling the lengths of printout that snared him
in his passage.  There were more of the articulated chairs, here,
something that resembled a bar, and the Hosaka.  The printer,
still spewing its flimsy tongue of paper, was an in-built bulk-

turned and stared at the Hosaka.  Its face had been drilled through,
at least a dozen times.  The holes were small, circular, edges
blackened.  Tiny spheres of bright alloy were orbiting the dead

Case ripped the printout from its slot.  More zeros.  `Win-

space scrawled with drifting curves of paper.  `That you on the
lights, Wintermute?'
A panel beside Maelcum's head slid up, revealing a small
monitor.  Maelcum jerked apprehensively, wiped sweat from
his forehead with a foam patch on the back of a gloved hand,
and swung to study the display.  `You read Japanese, mon?'
Case could see figures blinking past on the screen.
`No,' Case said.

`I don't exactly trust Wintermute to give it to me.'
The construct's hideous approximation of laughter scraped
Case's nerves like a dull blade.  `Maybe that means you're
gettin'~ smart.'
He hit the simstim switch.

following her progress through Villa Straylight for over an
hour, letting the endorphin analog she'd taken blot out his
hangover.  The pain in her leg was gone; she seemed to move
through a warm bath.  The Braun drone was perched on her
shoulder, its tiny manipulators, like padded surgical clips, se-
cure in the polycarbon of the Modern suit.
The walls here were raw steel, striped with rough brown
ribbons of epoxy where some kind of covering had been ripped
away.  She'd hidden from a work crew, crouching, the fletcher
cradled in her hands, her suit steel-gray, while the two slender
Africans and their balloon-tired workcart passed.  The men had
shaven heads and wore orange coveralls.  One was singing softly
to himself in a language Case had never heard, the tones and

concrete they'd mixed from pulverized lunar stone, grown in
welded steel and tons of knick-knacks, all the bizarre impe-
dimentia they'd shipped up the well to line their winding nest.
But it wasn't a craziness he understood.  Not like Armitage's
madness, which he now imagined he could understand; twist
a man far enough, then twist him as far back, in the opposite
direction, reverse and twist again.  The man broke.  Like break-
ing a length of wire.  And history had done that for Colonel

point, the Armitage mechanism had crumbled; Corto had sur-

was dead, a small frozen moon for Freeside.
He thought of the toxin sacs.  Old Ashpool was dead too,
drilled through the eye with Molly's microscopic dart, deprived
of whatever expert overdose he'd mixed for himself.  That was
a more puzzling death, Ashpool's, the death of a mad king.
And he'd killed the puppet he'd called his daughter, the one
with 3Jane's face.  It seemed to Case, as he rode Molly's broad-
cast sensory input through the corridors of Straylight, that he'd

never really thought of anyone like Ashpool, anyone as pow-
erful as he imagined Ashpool had been, as human.
Power, in Case's world, meant corporate power.  The zai-
batsus, the multinationals that shaped the course of human
history, had transcended old barriers.  Viewed as organisms,
they had attained a kind of immortality.  You couldn't kill a
zaibatsu by assassinating a dozen key executives; there were
others waiting to step up the ladder, assume the vacated po-
sition, access the vast banks of corporate memory.  But Tessier-
Ashpool wasn't like that, and he sensed the difference in the
death of its founder.  T-A was an atavism, a clan.  He remem-
bered the litter of the old man's chamber, the soiled humanity
of it, the ragged spines of the old audio disks in their paper
sleeves.  One foot bare, the other in a velvet slipper.
The Braun plucked at the hood of the Modern suit and Molly
turned left, through another archway.

Servo: Thank you! I didn't think you could tell through these trousers. 

Wintermute and the nest.  Phobic vision of the hatching
wasps, time-lapse machine gun of biology.  But weren't the
zaibatsus more like that, or the Yakuza, hives with cybernetic
memories, vast single organisms, their DNA coded in silicon?
If Straylight was an expression of the corporate identity of
Tessier-Ashpool, then T-A was crazy as the old man had been.
The same ragged tangle of fears, the same strange sense of
aimlessness.  `If they'd turned into what they wanted to...'
he remembered Molly saying.  But Wintermute had told her
they hadn't.

Mike: don't even know what panties are, yet they feel compelled to raid.

Case had always taken it for granted that the real bosses,
the kingpins in a given industry, would be both more and less
than _people._  He'd seen it in the men who'd crippled him in

ganism.  It was the root of street cool, too, the knowing posture
that implied connection, invisible lines up to hidden levels of
influence.
But what was happening now, in the corridors of Villa
Straylight?
Whole stretches were being stripped back to steel and con-
crete.
`Wonder where our Peter is now, huh?  Maybe see that boy
soon,' she muttered.  `And Armitage.  Where's he, Case?'

Vince: You set a record with me a long time ago.

`Dead,' he said, knowing she couldn't hear him, `he's
dead.'
He flipped.

The Chinese program was face to face with the target ice,
rainbow tints gradually dominated by the green of the rectangle
representing the T-A cores.  Arches of emerald across the col-
orless void.
`How's it go Dixie?'
`Fine.  Too slick.  Thing's amazing...  Shoulda had one that
time in Singapore.  Did the old New Bank of Asia for a good
fiftieth of what they were worth.  But that's ancient history.

`If this kinda shit was on the street; we'd be out a job,'

Mike: Why, it's befuddlin' mah dumb cracker mind! Servo, Mike, or Crow: Packers! 

Case said.
`You wish.  Wait'll you're steering that thing upstairs through
black ice.'
`Sure.'
Something small and decidedly nongeometric had just ap-
peared on the far end of one of the emerald arches.
`Dixie...'
`Yeah.  I see it.  Don't know if I believe it.'
A brownish dot, a dull gnat against the green wall of the

T-A cores.  It began to advance, across the bridge built by
Kuang Grade Mark Eleven, and Case saw that it was walking.
As it came, the green section of the arch extended, the poly-
chrome of the virus program rolling back, a few steps ahead
of the cracked black shoes.
`Gotta hand it to you, boss,' the Flatline said, when the
short, rumpled figure of the Finn seemed to stand a few meters
away.  `I never seen anything this funny when I was alive.'
But the eerie nonlaugh didn't come.
`I never tried it before,' the Finn said, showing his teeth,
his hands bunched in the pockets of his frayed jacket.
`You killed Armitage,' Case said.
`Corto.  Yeah.  Armitage was already gone.  Hadda do it.  I

lit up one of his Partagas.

Tom: Meg's mad at me.

`Why'd he kill himself?' Case asked.
`Why's anybody kill himself?'  The figure shrugged.  `I guess
I know, if anybody does, but it would take me twelve hours
to explain the various factors in his history and how they in-
terrelate.  He was ready to do it for a long time, but he kept
going back into the freezer.  Christ, he was a tedious old fuck.'
The Finn's face wrinkled with disgust.  `It's all tied in with

flicked his butt away into the matrix below.  `Well, actually,

I guess I did give 3Jane the odd hint, a little of the old how-

`Wintermute,' Case said, choosing the words carefully,
`you told me you were just a part of something else.  Later on,
you said you wouldn't exist, if the run goes off and Molly gets
the word into the right slot.'

Servo: Meet me at the karate rink later. 

The Finn's streamlined skull nodded.

Crow: Head towards the drain. 

`Okay, then who we gonna be dealing with then?  If Ar-
mitage is dead, and you're gonna be gone, just who exactly is
going to tell me how to get these fucking toxin sacs out of my

Servo: Oh, "Life is a like box of chocolates"? Well I got a better analogy! "Life is like a crap sandwich! The more bread you got, the less crap you gotta take!" Sheesh! 

The Finn took a wooden toothpick from his pocket and
regarded it critically, like a surgeon examining a scalpel.  `Good

Khorsa: You sleep in the barn!

These fish, see, they're _compelled_ to swim upstream.  Got it?'
`No,' Case said.
`Well, I'm under compulsion myself.  And I don't know
why.  If I were gonna subject you to my very own thoughts,
let's call 'em speculations, on the topic, it would take a couple
of your lifetimes.  Because I've given it a lot of thought.  And
I just don't know.  But when this is over, we do it right, I'm
gonna be part of something bigger.  Much bigger,' The Finn
glanced up and around the matrix.  `But the parts of me that
are me now, that'll still be here.  And you'll get your
payoff.'
Case fought back an insane urge to punch himself forward
and get his fingers around the figure's throat, just above the
ragged knot in the rusty scarf.  His thumbs deep in the Finn's
larynx.
`Well, good luck,' the Finn said.  He turned, hands in pock-
ets and began trudging back up the green arch.
`Hey, asshole,' the Flatline said, when the Finn had gone
a dozen paces.  The figure paused, half turned.  `What about
me?  What about my payoff?'

Eric: Jenni, this is Mickey.

`You'll get yours,' it said.
`What's that mean?' Case asked, as he watched the narrow
tweed back recede.

Servo: Then I'll be right back.

`I wanna be erased,' the construct said.  `I told you that,
remember?'

Straylight reminded Case of deserted early morning shop-
ping centers he'd known as a teenager, low-density places
where the small hours brought a fitful stillness, a kind of numb
expectancy, a tension that left you watching insects swarm
around caged bulbs above the entrance of darkened shops.
Fringe places, just past the borders of the Sprawl, too far from
the all-night click and shudder of the hot core.  There was that
same sense of being surrounded by the sleeping inhabitants of
a waking world he had no interest in visiting or knowing, of
dull business temporarily suspended, of futility and repetition
soon to wake again.
Molly had slowed now, either knowing that she was nearing
her goal or out of concern for her leg.  The pain was starting

wasn't sure what that meant.  She didn't speak, kept her teeth
clenched, and carefully regulated her breathing.  She'd passed
many things that Case hadn't understood, but his curiosity was
gone.  There had been a room filled with shelves of books, a

of cloth or leather, the shelves marked at intervals by labels

gaze had tracked the brass plaque automatically -- _`La marie

touched this, her artificial nails clicking against the Lexan sand-
wich protecting the broken glass.  There had been what was
obviously the entrance to Tessier-Ashpool's cryogenic com-
pound, circular doors of black glass trimmed with chrome.
She'd seen no one since the two Africans and their cart,
and for Case they'd taken on a sort of imaginary life; he pictured
them gliding gently through the halls of Straylight, their smooth
dark skulls gleaming, nodding, while the one still sang his tired
little song.  And none of this was anything like the Villa Stray-
light he would have expected, some cross between Cath's fairy

One and a half hours.
`Case,' she said, `I wanna favor.'  Stiffly, she lowered
herself to sit on a stack of polished steel plates, the finish of
each plate protected by an uneven coating of clear plastic.  She
picked at a rip in the plastic on the topmost plate, blades sliding
from beneath thumb and forefinger.  `Leg's not good, you know?

Mike: ...you fine!

corridor.
The bare steel and scabrous epoxy ended abruptly, replaced
by what Case at first took to be a rough tunnel blasted from
solid rock.  Molly examined its edge and he saw that in fact
the steel was sheathed with panels of something that looked

like a fluid, leaving the surface undisturbed.  A dozen meters
ahead, the tunnel curved.  Harsh yellow light threw hard shad-

realized that the gravity here was near earth normal, which

ror for cowboys.
But she wasn't lost, he told himself.

Servo: Our hero: a big, stinky cheater! 

Something scurried between her legs and went ticking across
the un-sand of the floor.  A red LED blinked.  The Braun.
The first of the holos waited just beyond the curve, a sort
of triptych.  She lowered the fletcher before Case had had time
to realize that the thing was a recording.  The figures were
caricatures in light, lifesize cartoons: Molly, Armitage, and
Case.  Molly's breasts were too large, visible through tight black

mesh beneath a heavy leather jacket.  Her waist was impossibly
narrow.  Silvered lenses covered half her face.  She held an
absurdly elaborate weapon of some kind, a pistol shape nearly
lost beneath a flanged overlay of scope sights, silencers, flash
hiders.  Her legs were spread, pelvis canted forward, her mouth
fixed in a leer of idiotic cruelty.  Beside her, Armitage stood
rigidly at attention in a threadbare khaki uniform.  His eyes,
Case saw, as Molly stepped carefully forward, were tiny mon-
itor screens, each one displaying the blue-gray image of a
howling waste of snow, the stripped black trunks of evergreens
bending in silent winds.
She passed the tips of her fingers through Armitage's tele-
vision eyes, then turned to the figure of Case.  Here, it was as

if Riviera -- and Case had known instantly that Riviera was
responsible -- had been unable to find anything worthy of par-
ody.  The figure that slouched there was a fair approximation
of the one he glimpsed daily in mirrors.  Thin, high-shouldered,

a forgettable face beneath short dark hair.  He needed a shave,
but then he usually did.
Molly stepped back.  She looked from one figure to another.
It was a static display, the only movement the silent gusting
of the black trees in Armitage's frozen Siberian eyes.
`Tryin'~ to tell us something, Peter?' she asked softly.  Then
she stepped forward and kicked at something between the feet
of the holo-Molly.  Metal clinked against the wall and the figures
were gone.  She bent and picked up a small display unit.  `Guess
he can jack into these and program them direct,' she said,
tossing it away.

Cooper: I chew places like this up and spit them into the toilet.

She passed the source of yellow light, an archaic incandes-
cent globe set into the wall, protected by a rusty curve of
expansion grating.  The style of the improvised fixture sug-
gested childhood, somehow.  He remembered fortresses he'd
built with other children on rooftops and in flooded sub-base-
ments.  A rich kid's hideout, he thought.  This kind of roughness
was expensive.  What they called atmosphere.
She passed a dozen more holograms before she reached the
entrance to 3Jane's apartments.  One depicted the eyeless thing
in the alley behind the Spice Bazaar, as it tore itself free of
Riviera's shattered body.  Several others were scenes of torture,
the inquisitors always military officers and the victims invari-
ably young women.  These had the awful intensity of Riviera's
show at the Vingtime Sicle, as though they had been frozen
in the blue flash of orgasm.  Molly looked away as she passed

Crow: ...are over-accessorized. .

them.
The last was small and dim, as if it were an image Riviera
had had to drag across some private distance of memory and
time.  She had to kneel to examine it; it had been projected
from the vantage point of a small child.  None of the others
had had backgrounds; the figures, uniforms, instruments of
torture, all had been freestanding displays.  But this was a view.
A dark wave of rubble rose against a colorless sky, beyond
its crest the bleached, half-melted skeletons of city towers.  The
rubble wave was textured like a net, rusting steel rods twisted
gracefully as fine string, vast slabs of concrete still clinging
there.  The foreground might once have been a city square;
there was a sort of stump, something that suggested a fountain.
At its base, the children and the soldier were frozen.  The tableau
was confusing at first.  Molly must have read it correctly before
Case had quite assimilated it, because he felt her tense.  She
spat, then stood.
Children.  Feral, in rags.  Teeth glittering like knives.  Sores
on their contorted faces.  The soldier on his back, mouth and
throat open to the sky.  They were feeding.
`Bonn,' she said, something like gentleness in her voice.
`Quite the product, aren't you, Peter?  But you had to be.  Our
3Jane, she's too jaded now to open the back door for just any

And then she was walking -- strolling, really, in spite of the
pain -- away from Riviera's childhood.  She drew the fletcher

the neck of the Modern suit and ripped it open to the crotch
with a single gesture, her thumb blade parting the tough po-

legs, the shredded remnants disguising themselves as they fell
to the dark false sand.

Crow: I have a feeling one of these characters is about to see their own intestines!

horns and piano.

five-meter gash in the tunnel wall, uneven stairs leading down
in a broad shallow curve.  Faint blue light, moving shadows,

`Case,' she said, and paused, the fletcher in her right hand.
Then she raised her left, smiled, touched her open palm with
a wet tongue tip, kissing him through the simstim link.  `Gotta
go.'
Then there was something small and heavy in her left hand,

flying across the board.  She had it: the thing, the moves.  And
she'd pulled it all together for her entrance.  Pulled it together
around the pain in her leg and marched down 3Jane's stairs
like she owned the place, elbow of her gun arm at her hip,
forearm up, wrist relaxed, swaying the muzzle of the fletcher
with the studied nonchalance of a Regency duelist.
It was a performance.  It was like the culmination of a life-
time's observation of martial arts tapes, cheap ones, the kind

hull, chopping away the maze of walls that was her legacy.
She lived in a single room so broad and deep that its far reaches
were lost to an inverse horizon, the floor hidden by the cur-
vature of the spindle.  The ceiling was low and irregular, done
in the same imitation stone that walled the corridor.  Here and
there across the floor were jagged sections of wall, waist-high
reminders of the labyrinth.  There was a rectangular turquoise
pool centered ten meters from the foot of the stairway, its
underwater floods the apartment's only source of light -- or it
seemed that way, to Case, as Molly took her final step.  The

on the simstim link.  The effect was like tape run at half speed,
a slow, deliberate dance choreographed to the killer instinct
and years of training.  She seemed to take the three of them in
at a glance: the boy poised on the pool's high board, the girl
grinning over her wineglass, and the corpse of Ashpool, his
left socket gaping black and corrupt above his welcoming smile.
He wore his maroon robe.  His teeth were very white.
The boy dove.  Slender, brown, his form perfect.  The gre-
nade left her hand before his hands could cut the water.  Case
knew the thing for what it was as it broke the surface: a core

Joel: Can you feel me near you? (Joel has made a skit about the 'Magic' scene, with Servo and Crow suspended on wires, ascending and descending wildly and awkwardly)

Her fletcher whined as she sent a storm of explosive darts
into Ashpool's face and chest, and he was gone, smoke curling
from the pocked back of the empty, white-enameled pool chair.
The muzzle swung for 3Jane as the grenade detonated, a
symmetrical wedding cake of water rising, breaking, falling
back, but the mistake had been made.
Hideo didn't even touch her, then.  Her leg collapsed.

sphere the size of a bowling ball.  `I saw a multiple assassination
in Ankara,' he said, his fingers plucking things from her jacket,

The little Cray monitor lit.  The Finn, against a background
of twisted, impacted junk.  `Neither do I.  We gotta problem.'

they given her?  The pain was still there, but it came through
as a tight focus of scrambled impressions.  Neon worms writhing
in her thigh, the touch of burlap, smell of frying krill -- his
mind recoiled from it.  If he avoided focusing on it, the impres-
sions overlapped, became a sensory equivalent of white noise.

Servo: Look Mike, Birdman of Alcatraz, three stars. Marginally better than Laserblast.

If it could do that to her nervous system, what would her frame
of mind be?
Her vision was abnormally clear and bright, even sharper
than usual.  Things seemed to vibrate, each person or object
tuned to a minutely different frequency.  Her hands, still locked
in the black ball, were on her lap.  She sat in one of the pool
chairs, her broken leg propped straight in front of her on a
camelskin hassock.  3Jane sat opposite, on another hassock,
huddled in an oversized djellaba of unbleached wool.  She was
very young.
`Where'd he go?' Molly asked.  `To take his shot?'
3Jane shrugged beneath the folds of the pale heavy robe and
tossed a strand of dark hair away from her eyes.  `He told me
when to let you in,' she said.  `He wouldn't tell me why.
Everything has to be a mystery.  Would you have hurt us?'
Case felt Molly hesitate.  `I would've killed him.  I'd've tried
to kill the ninja.  Then I was supposed to talk with you.'
`Why?' 3Jane asked, tucking the cameo back into one of

the djellaba's inner pockets.  `And why?  And what about?'

Crow: Yeah, right. 

Molly seemed to be studying the high, delicate bones, the
wide mouth, the narrow hawk nose.  3Jane's eyes were dark,
curiously opaque.  `Because I hate him,' she said at last, `and
the why of that's just the way I'm wired, what he is and what
I am.'
`And the show,' 3Jane said.  `I saw the show.'
Molly nodded.
`But Hideo?'
`Because they're the best.  Because one of them killed a
partner of mine, once.'

Crow: Hey, we're tryin' to film here!

3Jane became very grave.  She raised her eyebrows.
`Because I had to see,' Molly said.
`And then we would have talked, you and I?  Like this?'
Her dark hair was very straight, center-parted, drawn back into

a knot of dull sterling.  `Shall we talk now?'
`Take this off,' Molly said, raising her captive hands.
`You killed my father,' 3Jane said, no change whatever in
her tone.  `I was watching on the monitors.  My mother's eyes,
he called them.'
`He killed the puppet.  It looked like you.'
`He was fond of broad gestures,' she said, and then Riviera
was beside her, radiant with drugs, in the seersucker convict
outfit he'd worn in the roof garden of their hotel.

`Isn't it, Peter?'  Molly managed a grin.

He has his profiles, but those are only statistics.  You may be

possess a quality unquantifiable by its very nature.'  He drank.
`And what exactly is that, Peter?' Molly asked, her voice
flat.

Mike: Maybe they ship fully inflated balloons overseas? 

Riviera beamed.  `Perversity.'  He walked back to the two
women, swirling the water that remained in the dense, deeply
carved cylinder of rock crystal, as though he enjoyed the weight
of the thing.  `An enjoyment of the gratuitous act.  And I have

She waited, looking up at him.
`Oh, Peter,' 3Jane said, with the sort of gentle exasperation
ordinarily reserved for children.

off the last of the mineral water.  `No, you wouldn't do, Daddy,
you would not do.  Now that Peter's come home.'  And then,
his face pink with the pleasure of cocaine and meperidine, he
swung the glass hard into her left lens implant, smashing vision
into blood and light.

`You keep tools back there?'  Case craned his neck and
watched cords of muscle bunching in the brown back.

Servo: Why am I watching this? 

`This one,' Maelcum said, sliding a long bundle wrapped
in black poly from the space behind the panel.  He replaced the
panel, along with a single hexhead to hold it in place.  The
black package had drifted aft before he'd finished.  He thumbed
open the vacuum valves on the workbelt's gray pads and freed
himself, retrieving the thing he'd removed.
He kicked back, gliding over his instruments -- a green
docking diagram pulsed on his central screen -- and snagged
the frame of Case's g-web.  He pulled himself down and picked
at the tape of his package with a thick, chipped thumbnail.

He jacked in.

`Wonderful,' the Flatline said, `I never did like to do any-

Case flipped.

was the taste of old iron, scent of melon, wings of a moth

registered the vibrations of the girl's voice.  Riviera said some-
thing brief and indistinct.  `But I don't,' she said, `and it isn't
fun.  Hideo will bring a medical unit down from intensive care,
but this needs a surgeon.'

Crow: Bart Fargo. Bartfargobartfargobartfargobartfargo... Heh, that's hard! 

There was a silence.  Very distinctly, Case heard the water
lap against the side of the pool.
`What was that you were telling her, when I came back?'
Riviera was very close now.
`About my mother.  She asked me to.  I think she was in
shock, aside from Hideo's injection.  Why did you do that to
her?'
`I wanted to see if they would break.'

Crow: Oh! "Federated Incorporated Industries Limited".

`One did.  When she comes around -- if she comes around --
we'll see what color her eyes are.'
`She's extremely dangerous.  Too dangerous.  If I hadn't
been here to distract her, to throw up Ashpool to distract her
and my own Hideo to draw her little bomb, where would you
be?  In her power.'
`No,' 3Jane said, `there was Hideo.  I don't think you quite
understand about Hideo.  She does, evidently.'

Fingal: Listen! We're nothing more than a byte in a giant computer! Mike, Crow, ServoI'm okay with that. 

`Like a drink?'
`Wine.  The white.'
Case jacked out.

Maelcum was hunched over _Garvey_'s controls, tapping out
commands for a docking sequence.  The module's central screen
displayed a fixed red square that represented the Straylight

dock.  _Garvey_ was a larger square, green, that shrank slowly,
wavering from side to side with Maelcum's commands.  To the
left, a smaller screen displayed a skeletal graphic of _Garvey_
and _Haniwa_ as they approached the curvature of the spindle.

good for ninety minutes, but the Flatline's construct would be
an additional drain.  He worked quickly, mechanically, fasten-
ing the construct to the bottom of the Ono-Sendai with micro-
pore tape.  Maelcum's workbelt drifted past.  He snagged it,
unclipped the two lengths of shock cord, with their gray rec-
tangular suction pads, and hooked the jaws of one clip through

worked the thumb lever that created suction.  With the deck,

of his pockets.  The passport Armitage had given him, the bank
chip in the same name, the credit chip he'd been issued when
he'd entered Freeside, two derms of the betaphenethylamine
he'd bought from Bruce, a roll of New Yen, half a pack of
Yeheyuans, and the shuriken.  He tossed the Freeside chip over
his shoulders, heard it click off the Russian scrubber.  He was
about to do the same with the steel star, but the rebounding
credit chip clipped the back of his skull, spun off, struck the
ceiling, and tumbled past Maelcum's left shoulder.  The Zionite
interrupted his piloting to glare back at him.  Case looked at
the shuriken, then tucked it into his jacket pocket, hearing the
lining tear.
`You missin'~ th'~ Mute, mon,' Maelcum said.  `Mute say

`We gonna wear the suits?'

the worn pink handholds on either side of the navigation board.
Case saw the green square shrink a final few millimeters to

overlap the red square.  On the smaller screen, _Haniwa_ lowered
her bow to miss the curve of the spindle and was snared.  _Garvey_
was still slung beneath her like a captive grub.  The tug rang,
shuddered.  Two stylized arms sprang out to grip the slender
wasp shape.  Straylight extruded a tentative yellow rectangle
that curved, groping past _Haniwa_ for _Garvey._

April: Yes? What can I do for you?

There was a scraping sound from the bow, beyond the trem-
bling fronds of caulk.
`Mon,' Maelcum said, `mind we got gravity.'  A dozen
small objects struck the floor of the cabin simultaneously, as
though drawn there by a magnet.  Case gasped as his internal
organs were pulled into a different configuration.  The deck and
construct had fallen painfully to his lap.
They were attached to the spindle now, rotating with it.
Maelcum spread his arms, flexed tension from his shoulders,
and removed his purple dreadbag, shaking out his locks.  `Come

The Villa Straylight was a parasitic structure, Case reminded
himself, as he stepped past the tendrils of caulk and through
_Marcus Garvey_'s forward hatch.  Straylight bled air and water
out of Freeside, and had no ecosystem of its own.
The gangway tube the dock had extended was a more elab-
orate version of the one he'd tumbled through to reach _Haniwa,_
designed for use in the spindle's rotation gravity.  A corrugated
tunnel, articulated by integral hydraulic members, each seg-
ment ringed with a loop of tough, nonslip plastic, the loops
serving as the rungs of a ladder.  The gangway had snaked its
way around _Haniwa;_ it was horizontal, where it joined _Garvey_'s
lock, but curved up sharply and to the left, a vertical climb
around the curvature of the yacht's hull.  Maelcum was already
making his way up the rings, pulling himself up with his left
hand, the Remington in his right.  He wore a stained pair of
baggy fatigues, his sleeveless green nylon jacket, and a pair
of ragged canvas sneakers with bright red soles.  The gangway
shifted slightly, each time he climbed to another ring.
The clips on Case's makeshift strap dug into his shoulder
with the weight of the Ono-Sendai and the Flatline's construct.
All he felt now was fear, a generalized dread.  He pushed it
away, forcing himself to replay Armitage's lecture on the spin-
dle and Villa Straylight.  He started climbing.  Freeside's eco-
system was limited, not closed.  Zion was a closed system,

Servo: Huh? Why did they blank out "former host of Talk Soup"?

capable of cycling for years without the introduction of external
materials.  Freeside produced its own air and water, but relied
on constant shipments of food, on the regular augmentation
of soil nutrients.  The Villa Straylight produced nothing at all.
`Mon,' Maelcum said quietly, `get up here, 'side me.'  Case
edged sideways on the circular ladder and climbed the last few
rungs.  The gangway ended in a smooth, slightly convex hatch,
two meters in diameter.  The hydraulic members of the tube
vanished into flexible housings set into the frame of the hatch.
`So what do we --'
Case's mouth shut as the hatch swung up, a slight differential
in pressure puffing fine grit into his eyes.

Crow: Yeah! There was a lot of Dorkin at the beginning of the movie. They should show that some more.

Maelcum scrambled up, over the edge, and Case heard the
tiny click of the Remington's safety being released.  `You th'~
mon in th'~ hurry...'  Maelcum whispered, crouching there.
Then Case was beside him.
The hatch was centered in a round, vaulted chamber floored
with blue nonslip plastic tiles.  Maelcum nudged him, pointed,

Servo: Hang on Earl, I gotta read this sign here: "Leave the Bronx". Well, gee. 

and he saw a monitor set into a curved wall.  On the screen, a
tall young man with the Tessier-Ashpool features was brushing
something from the sleeves of his dark suitcoat.  He stood beside

said a voice from a grid centered above the hatch.  Case glanced
up.  `Expected you later, at the axial dock.  One moment, please.'
On the monitor, the young man tossed his head impatiently.
Maelcum spun as a door slid open to their left, the shotgun
ready.  A small Eurasian in orange coveralls stepped through

and goggled at them.  He opened his mouth, but nothing came
out.  He closed his mouth.  Case glanced at the monitor.  Blank.
`Who?' the man managed.

the thighs of his orange suit.
`No, mon, this a real one.'  Maelcum came up out of his
crouch with the Remington pointed at the Eurasian's face.  `You

They followed the man back through the door, into a corridor

whose polished concrete walls and irregular floor of overlap-

Maelcum said, prodding the man in the back.  `Smell like

They came to another monitor, an antique Sony, this one

cum nudged his captive along, Case knelt and fumbled through
an assortment of plugs, finally coming up with the one he
needed.  With his deck jacked into the adaptor, he paused.
`Do you have to look like that, man?' he asked the face on
the screen.  The Finn was erased a line at a time by the image
of Lonny Zone against a wall of peeling Japanese posters.

Mr. B Natural: When you want to show dignity, Buzz, try a French horn!

`Anything you want, baby,' Zone drawled, `just hop it for

Angela: Hello! 

Lonny...'
`No,' Case said, `use the Finn.'  As the Zone image van-
ished, he shoved the Hitachi adaptor into its socket and settled
the trodes across his forehead.

`What kept you?' the Flatline asked, and laughed.
`Told you don't do that,' Case said.
`Joke, boy,' the construct said, `zero time lapse for me.
Lemme see what we got here...'
The Kuang program was green, exactly the shade of the
T-A ice.  Even as Case watched, it grew gradually more opaque,
although he could see the black-mirrored shark thing clearly
when he looked up.  The fracture lines and hallucinations were
gone now, and the thing looked real as _Marcus Garvey,_ a

`Right on,' the Flatline said.
`Right,' Case said, and flipped.

damage to the eye.  You didn't know him very well, before
you came here?'
`Didn't know him at all,' Molly said bleakly.  She was on
her back on a high bed or padded table.  Case couldn't feel the
injured leg.  The synaesthetic effect of the original injection
seemed to have worn off.  The, black ball was gone, but her
hands were immobilized by soft straps she couldn't see.

Bomar: I want to see more toys!

`He wants to kill you.'
`Figures,' Molly said, staring up at the rough ceiling past
a very bright light.
`I don't think I want him to,' 3Jane said, and Molly pain-
fully turned her head to look up into the dark eyes.
`Don't play with me,' she said.
`But I think I might like to,' 3Jane said, and bent to kiss

Mike: Uh, if you could help me out by climbing in...

her forehead, brushing the hair back with a warm hand.  There
were smears of blood on her pale djellaba.
`Where's he gone now?' Molly asked.
`Another injection, probably,' 3Jane said, straightening up.
`He was quite impatient for your arrival.  I think it might be
fun to nurse you back to health, Molly.'  She smiled, absently
wiping a bloody hand down the front of the robe.  `Your leg
will need to be reset, but we can arrange that.'
`What about Peter?'
`Peter.'  She gave her head a little shake.  A strand of dark
hair came loose, fell across her forehead.  `Peter has become
rather boring.  I find drug use in general to be boring.'  She
giggled.  `In others, at any rate.  My father was a dedicated
abuser, as you must have seen.'
Molly tensed.
`Don't alarm yourself.'  3Jane's fingers brushed the skin

above the waistband of the leather jeans.  `His suicide was the
result of my having manipulated the safety margins of his

after he last went down to sleep.  But I did know him _very_ well.

show you that, when you're better.  He strangles her in bed.'
`Why did he kill her?'  Her unbandaged eye focused on the
girl's face.

`You said you were trying to kill the old man?  You fiddled
his cryogenic programs?'

Mike: If you're looking for her panties I'm already wearing the good ones. 

3Jane nodded.  `I had help.  From a ghost.  That was what I
thought when I was very young, that there were ghosts in the

to Molly's lips.  `Water.  Only a little.'

`Jane, love,' Riviera asked cheerfully, from somewhere out
of sight, `are you enjoying yourself?'
`Leave us alone, Peter.'
`Playing doctor...'  Suddenly Molly stared into her own
face, the image suspended ten centimeters from her nose.  There
were no bandages.  The left implant was shattered, a long finger
of silvered plastic driven deep in a socket that was an inverted
pool of blood.

Joel: Oh, terrific — we were saved by the gates of Hell.

`Hideo,' 3Jane said, stroking Molly's stomach, _`hurt_ Peter

The projection vanished.

on its nylon thong, against the inner curve of her left breast.
`Yes,' 3Jane said, withdrawing her hand, `I do.  I learned
it as a child.  I think I learned it in a dream...  Or somewhere
in the thousand hours of my mother's diaries.  But I think that
Peter has a point, in urging me not to surrender it.  There would
be Turing to contend with, if I read all this correctly, and ghosts
are nothing if not capricious.'
Case jacked out.


Crow: Industry: creating a better world. Our most valuable resource? People! He's a maniac! A maniac! And he's dancing like he's never danced before! He's a steel town boy on a Saturday... 

`Strange little customer, huh?'  The Finn grinned at Case
from the old Sony.
Case shrugged.  He saw Maelcum coming back along the
corridor with the Remington at his side.  The Zionite was smil-

sleeveless jacket.

Servo: Forget about life-jackets this is The 50's. 

`Dub, mon,' Maelcum said.
`You're fucking crazy,' Case told him.

Joel: You go out to the bridge, stay frosty! I've got a plan!  

`Hear okay, mon.  Righteous dub.'

Gregory: Look at this. Blonde hair.

`Hey, guys,' the Finn said, `on your toes.  Here comes your
transportation.  I can't finesse many numbers as smooth as the
pic of 8Jean that conned your doorman, but I can get you a
ride over to 3Jane's place.'
Case was pulling the adaptor from its socket when the rid-
erless service cart swiveled into sight, under the graceless con-
crete arch marking the far end of their corridor.  It might have

gone now.  Just behind the back of the low padded seat, its tiny
manipulators gripping the upholstery, the little Braun was
steadily winking its red LED.
`Bus to catch,' Case said to Maelcum.

He'd lost his anger again.  He missed it.
The little cart was crowded: Maelcum, the Remington across
his knees, and Case, deck and construct against his chest.  The
cart was operating at speeds it hadn't been designed for, it was

in the direction of the turns.  This presented no problem when

right turns the Zionite had to lean across Case and his gear,
crushing him against the seat.
He had no idea where they were.  Everything was familiar,

but he couldn't be sure he'd seen any particular stretch before.
A curving hallway lined with wooden showcases displayed
collections he was certain he'd never seen: the skulls of large
birds, coins, masks of beaten silver.  The service cart's six tires
were silent on the layered carpets.  There was only the whine
of the electric motor and an occasional faint burst of Zion dub,

Crow: Get out from behind that cushion, Billy! It gets worse! 

`You got a watch?' he asked Maelcum.
The Zionite shook his locks.  `Time be time.'
`Jesus,' Case said, and closed his eyes.


Kid: Did you say something?

The Braun scuttled over mounded carpets and tapped one
of its padded claws against an oversized rectangular door of
dark battered wood.  Behind them, the cart sizzled and shot
blue sparks from a louvered panel.  The sparks struck the carpet
beneath the cart and Case smelled scorched wool.

Narrator: The children of the USA.

`This th'~ way, mon?'  Maelcum eyed the door and snapped
the shotgun's safety.
`Hey,' Case said, more to himself than to Maelcum, `you

LED strobed.
`It wan'~ you open door,' Maelcum said, nodding.
Case stepped forward and tried the ornate brass knob.  There
was a brass plate mounted on the door at eye level, so old that

hinges creaked plaintively as he edged it open, Maelcum step-
ping past him with the Remington thrust forward from his hip.

Mike: Hey, you guys, I got my dad's Enforcer for the weekend! 

`Books,' Maelcum said.
The library, the white steel shelves with their labels.
`I know where we are,' Case said.  He looked back at the
service cart.  A curl of smoke was rising from the carpet.  `So
come on,' he said.  `Cart.  Cart?'  It remained stationary.  The
Braun was plucking at the leg of his jeans, nipping at his ankle.
He resisted a strong urge to kick it.  `Yeah?'
It ticked its way around the door.  He followed it.
The monitor in the library was another Sony, as old as the
first one.  The Braun paused beneath it and executed a sort of
jig.
`Wintermute?'

Mike: Um, I cut both my wrists.

The familiar features filled the screen.  The Finn smiled.
`Time to check in, Case,' the Finn said, his eyes screwed

black cloth.  `Shit!'  He slapped it aside and it struck the wall.
Two of its limbs began to piston repeatedly, uselessly, pumping
the air.  `What's wrong with the goddam thing?'
`Burned out,' the Finn said.  `Forget it.  No problem.  Jack
in now.'
There were four sockets beneath the screen, but only one
would accept the Hitachi adaptor.
He jacked in.


Crow: Oh, look. Orion is bankrupt.

Nothing.  Gray void.
No matrix, no grid.  No cyberspace.
The deck was gone.  His fingers were...
And on the far rim of consciousness, a scurrying, a fleeting
impression of something rushing toward him, across leagues
of black mirror.
He tried to scream.

There seemed to be a city, beyond the curve of beach, but
it was far away.
He crouched on his haunches on the damp sand, his arms
wrapped tight across his knees, and shook.
He stayed that way for what seemed a very long time, even

Loudspeaker: This area has been declared uninhabitable, and destined for demolition! Leave now, and leave peacefully! 

after the shaking stopped.  The city, if it was a city, was low
and gray.  At times it was obscured by banks of mist that came
rolling in over the lapping surf.  At one point he decided that
it wasn't a city at all, but some single building, perhaps a ruin;
he had no way of judging its distance.  The sand was the shade
of tarnished silver that hadn't gone entirely black.  The beach
was made of sand, the beach was very long, the sand was
damp, the bottoms of his jeans were wet from the sand...  He
held himself and rocked, singing a song without words or tune.
The sky was a different silver.  Chiba.  Like the Chiba sky.
Tokyo Bay?  He turned his head and stared out to sea, longing
for the hologram logo of Fuji Electric, for the drone of a
helicopter, anything at all.

Servo: Which means I really, really hate the citizens and officials of Rutland, Vermont. I'm not kidding, Mike. I never liked the citizens and officials of stupid Rutland, Vermont! This is just the nail in the coffin, as far as I'm concerned. Go to hell, citizens and officials of Rutland, Vermont!

Behind him, a gull cried.  He shivered.
A wind was rising.  Sand stung his cheek.  He put his face
against his knees and wept, the sound of his sobbing as distant
and alien as the cry of the searching gull.  Hot urine soaked his
jeans, dribbled on the sand, and quickly cooled in the wind off
the water.  When his tears were gone, his throat ached.
`Wintermute,' he mumbled to his knees, `Wintermute...'
It was growing dark, now, and when he shivered, it was
with a cold that finally forced him to stand.
His knees and elbows ached.  His nose was running; he wiped
it on the cuff of his jacket, then searched one empty pocket

Servo: We done been et, over!

after another.  `Jesus,' he said, shoulders hunched, tucking his
fingers beneath his arms for warmth.  `Jesus.'  His teeth began
to chatter.
The tide had left the beach combed with patterns more subtle
than any a Tokyo gardener produced.  When he'd taken a dozen
steps in the direction of the now invisible city, he turned and
looked back through the gathering dark.  His footprints stretched
to the point of his arrival.  There were no other marks to disturb
the tarnished sand.
He estimated that he'd covered at least a kilometer before
he noticed the light.  He was talking with Ratz, and it was Ratz
who first pointed it out, an orange-red glow to his right, away
from the surf.  He knew that Ratz wasn't there, that the bartender
was a figment of his own imagination, not of the thing he was
trapped in, but that didn't matter.  He'd called the man up for
comfort of some kind, but Ratz had had his own ideas about
Case and his predicament.
`Really, my artiste, you amaze me.  The lengths you will
go to in order to accomplish your own destruction.  The re-

an artiste, no?  You needed this world built for you, this beach,
this place.  To die.'
Case halted, swayed, turned toward the sound of surf and
the sting of blown sand.  `Yeah,' he said.  `Shit.  I guess...'
He walked toward the sound.
`Artiste,' he heard Ratz call.  `The light.  You saw a light.

Crow: I think they blew their cover here! 

Here.  This way...'
He stopped again, staggered, fell to his knees in a few
millimeters of icy seawater.  `Ratz?  Light?  Ratz...'

Crow: I've written a letter to Daddy... 

But the dark was total, now, and there was only the sound
of the surf.  He struggled to his feet and tried to retrace his
steps.

Police Officer: Did you hear anything... footsteps... a door opening?

Time passed.  He walked on.
And then it was there, a glow, defining itself with his every
step.  A rectangle.  A door.
`Fire in there,' he said, his words torn away by the wind.
It was a bunker, stone or concrete, buried in drifts of the
dark sand.  The doorway was low, narrow, doorless, and deep,
set into a wall at least a meter thick.  `Hey,' Case said, softly,
`hey...'  His fingers brushed the cold wall.  There was a fire,
in there, shifting shadows on the sides of the entrance.
He ducked low and was through, inside, in three steps.
A girl was crouched beside rusted steel, a sort of fireplace,

chimney.  The fire was the only light, and as his gaze met the
wide, startled eyes, he recognized her headband, a rolled scarf,
printed with a pattern like magnified circuitry.

He refused her arms, that night, refused the food she offered
him, the place beside her in the nest of blankets and shredded
foam.  He crouched beside the door, finally, and watched her

he remembered from their trip across the Bay, and that was
cruel.
`Mean, motherfucker,' he whispered to the wind.  `Don't
take a chance, do you?  Wouldn't give me any junkie, huh?  I
know what this is...'  He tried to keep the desperation from
his voice.  `I know, see?  I know who you are.  You're the other

any sense.  You don't want Wintermute to pull his scam off,

Servo: This contract arrived for you from a Mr. Elzebub.

`Honey,' she said, twisting up from the rags of blankets,
`you come here and sleep.  I'll sit up, you want.  You gotta
sleep, okay?'  Her soft accent was exaggerated with sleep.  `You
just sleep, okay?'

When he woke, she was gone.  The fire was dead, but it
was warm in the bunker, sunlight slanting through the doorway
to throw a crooked rectangle of gold on the ripped side of a

remembered them from the Chiba docks.  Through the rent in
its side, he could see half a dozen bright yellow packets.  In
the sunlight, they looked like giant pats of butter.  His stomach
tightened with hunger.  Rolling out of the nest, he went to the
canister and fished one of the things out, blinking at small print
in a dozen languages.  The English was on the bottom.  EMERG.~

food, okay?'  With a packet in either hand, he made his way
through the structure's four rooms.  Two were empty, aside
from drifts of sand, and the fourth held three more of the ration
canisters.  `Sure,' he said touching the seals.  `Stay here a long
time.  I get the idea.  Sure...'
He searched the room with the fireplace, finding a plastic
canister filled with what he assumed was rainwater.  Beside the
nest of blankets, against the wall, lay a cheap red lighter, a
seaman's knife with a cracked green handle, and her scarf.  It
was still knotted, and stiff with sweat and dirt.  He used the

a rusted can that he found beside the stove.  He dipped water
from the canister, mixed the resulting mush with his fingers,
and ate.  It tasted vaguely like beef.  When it was gone, he

the sand.  In daylight, the beach was silver-gray.  The sky was
cloudless, blue.  He rounded the corner of the bunker and walked
toward the surf, dropping his jacket on the sand.  `Dunno whose
memories you're using for this one,' he said when he reached
the water.  He peeled off his jeans and kicked them into the

`What you doin'~, Case?'
He turned and found her ten meters down the beach, the
white foam sliding past her ankles.
`I pissed myself last night,' he said.

sores.  I'll show you this pool back in the rocks.'  She gestured
vaguely behind her.  `It's fresh.'  The faded French fatigues
had been hacked away above the knee; the skin below was
smooth and brown.  A breeze caught at her hair.
`Listen,' he said, scooping his clothes up and walking to-
ward her, `I got a question for you.  I won't ask you what
_you're_ doing here.  But what exactly do you think _I'm_ doing
here?'  He stopped, a wet black jeans-leg slapping against his
bare thigh.
`You came last night,' she said.  She smiled at him.
`And that's enough for you?  I just came?'

Crow: Steve One, you go that way. Steve Two, come with me! 

`He _said_ you would,' she said, wrinkling her nose.  She
shrugged.  `He knows stuff like that, I guess.'  She lifted her
left foot and rubbed salt from the other ankle, awkward, child-
like.  She smiled at him again, more tentatively.  `Now you

He nodded.
`How come you're painted brown like that, all except your

`And that's the last thing you remember?'  He watched her

She nodded, her eyes huge in the firelight.  `I'm sorry, Case,

hunched forward, forearms across her knees, her face twisted
for a few seconds with pain or its memory.  `I just needed the
money.  To get home, I guess, or... hell,' she said, `you
wouldn't hardly talk to me.'
`There's no cigarettes?'
`God_dam,_ Case, you asked me that ten times today!  What's
wrong with you?'  She twisted a strand of hair into her mouth
and chewed at it.
`But the food was here?  It was already here?'
`I _told_ you, man, it was washed up on the damn beach.'
`Okay.  Sure.  It's seamless.'
She started to cry again, a dry sobbing.  `Well, damn you

He got up, taking his jacket, and ducked through the door-

`No,' he said, and then it no longer mattered, what he knew,

Joel: And there's Elvis now. 

It was a place he'd known before; not everyone could take him
there, and somehow he always managed to forget it.  Something
he'd found and lost so many times.  It belonged, he knew --
he remembered -- as she pulled him down, to the meat, the
flesh the cowboys mocked.  It was a vast thing, beyond know-

ing, a sea of information coded in spiral and pheromone, infinite
intricacy that only the body, in its strong blind way, could ever

The zipper hung, caught, as he opened the French fatigues,
the coils of toothed nylon clotted with salt.  He broke it, some
tiny metal part shooting off against the wall as salt-rotten cloth
gave, and then he was in her, effecting the transmission of the
old message.  Here, even here, in a place he knew for what it
was, a coded model of some stranger's memory, the drive held.
She shuddered against him as the stick caught fire, a leaping
flare that threw their locked shadows across the bunker wall.
Later, as they lay together, his hand between her thighs, he
remembered her on the beach, the white foam pulling at her
ankles, and he remembered what she had said.
`He told you I was coming,' he said.
But she only rolled against him, buttocks against his thighs,
and put her hand over his, and muttered something out of
dream.




Crow: I was shaving this morning and got a nick!

The music woke him, and at first it might have been the
beat of his own heart.  He sat up beside her, pulling his jacket
over his shoulders in the predawn chill, gray light from the
doorway and the fire long dead.
His vision crawled with ghost hieroglyphs, translucent lines
of symbols arranging themselves against the neutral backdrop
of the bunker wall.  He looked at the backs of his hands, saw

unknowable code.  He raised his right hand and moved it ex-
perimentally.  It left a faint, fading trail of strobed afterimages.

Mike: ...so you can sugar-frost your damn cornflakes! Filthy American pigs. 

The hair stood up along his arms and at the back of his
neck.  He crouched there with his teeth bared and felt for the
music.  The pulse faded, returned, faded...
`What's wrong?'  She sat up, clawing hair from her eyes.
`Baby...'
`I feel... like a drug...  You get that here?'
She shook her head, reached for him, her hands on his upper
arms.
`Linda, who told you?  Who told you I'd come?  Who?'
`On the beach,' she said, something forcing her to look
away.  `A boy.  I see him on the beach.  Maybe thirteen.  He
lives here.'

Servo: This isn't a real movie, it's more of a movie loaf.

`And what did he say?'
`He said you'd come.  He said you wouldn't hate me.  He

began to struggle into his jeans.
`Case,' she said, her voice shaking, `Case, where you
goin'~?'
`I think I'll find that boy,' he said, as the music came
surging back, still only a beat, steady and familiar, although
he couldn't place it in memory.
`Don't, Case.'
`I thought I saw something, when I got here.  A city down
the beach.  But yesterday it wasn't there.  You ever seen that?'
He yanked his zipper up and tore at the impossible knot in his
shoelaces, finally tossing the shoes into the corner.

Servo: You're the worst party clown we ever had!...had...had... 

She nodded, eyes lowered.  `Yeah.  I see it sometimes.'

Joel: Oh, the joke's on us!

`You ever go there, Linda?'  He put his jacket on.
`No,' she said, `but I tried.  After I first came, an'~ I was

off.

Narrator: For the visitor, Progress Island offers a tremendous variety of experiences, beginning with the rich and colorful heritage of the Caribbean.

`What is it?'
`This thing,' she gestured around at the fireplace, the dark
walls, the dawn outlining the doorway, `where we live.  It gets
_smaller,_ Case, smaller, closer you get to it.'

about that?'
`Yeah.  He said I wouldn't understand, an'~ I was wastin'~
my time.  Said it was, was like... an _event._  An'~ it was our
horizon.  _Event horizon,_ he called it.'
The words meant nothing to him.  He left the bunker and
struck out blindly, heading -- he knew, somehow -- away from
the sea.  Now the hieroglyphs sped across the sand, fled from
his feet, drew back from him as he walked.  `Hey,' he said,
`it's breaking down.  Bet you know, too.  What is it?  Kuang?

Flatline's no pushover, huh?'
He heard her call his name.  Looked back and she was
following him, not trying to catch up, the broken zip of the
French fatigues flapping against the brown of her belly, pubic
hair framed in torn fabric.  She looked like one of the girls on

only she was tired and sad and human, the ripped costume
pathetic as she stumbled over clumps of salt-silver sea grass.

too thin against the sliding blue-gray of the tide.
`I know you,' Case said, Linda beside him.
`No,' the boy said, his voice high and musical, `you do
not.'
`You're the other AI.  You're Rio.  You're the one who wants
to stop Wintermute.  What's your name?  Your Turing code.
What is it?'
The boy did a handstand in the surf, laughing.  He walked
on his hands, then flipped out of the water.  His eyes were

but her lord choked her off before I could read the book of her
days.  Neuro from the nerves, the silver paths.  Romancer.  Nec-
romancer.  I call up the dead.  But no, my friend,' and the boy
did a little dance, brown feet printing the sand, `I _am_ the dead,
and their land.'  He laughed.  A gull cried.  `Stay.  If your woman
is a ghost, she doesn't know it.  Neither will you.'
`You're cracking.  The ice is breaking up.'

Servo: Sorry, Unitarian. According to you, I'm in the butterflies and the sun, and I'm just a vague, benevolent force.You're on your own.

`No,' he said, suddenly sad, his fragile shoulders sagging.
He rubbed his foot against the sand.  `It is more simple than
that.  But the choice is yours.'  The gray eyes regarded Case
gravely.  A fresh wave of symbols swept across his vision, one
line at a time.  Behind them, the boy wriggled, as though seen
through heat rising from summer asphalt.  The music was loud

Mike: Clown suit by Bargain Clown of Hollywood. 

now, and Case could almost make out the lyrics.
`Case, honey,' Linda said, and touched his shoulder.
`No,' he said.  He took off his jacket and handed it to her.
`I don't know,' he said, `maybe you're here.  Anyway, it gets
cold.'
He turned and walked away, and after the seventh step, he'd
closed his eyes, watching the music define itself at the center
of things.  He did look back, once, although he didn't open his

eyes.
He didn't need to.

Servo: And why I have a picture of a burger on the wall.

They were there by the edge of the sea, Linda Lee and the
thin child who said his name was Neuromancer.  His leather
jacket dangled from her hand, catching the fringe of the surf.
He walked on, following the music.
Maelcum's Zion dub.

Crow: I dub you Sir Moron. Come on, dummy. 


There was a gray place, an impression of fine screens shift-
ing, moire, degrees of half tone generated by a very simple
graphics program.  There was a long hold on a view through
chainlink, gulls frozen above dark water.  There were voices.
There was a plain of black mirror, that tilted, and he was

angles of an invisible maze, fragmenting, flowing together,

`Case?  Mon?'

Mike: Ah, the ocean's beautiful in this part of the tub. 

The music.
`You back, mon.'
The music was taken from his ears.
`How long?' he heard himself ask, and knew that his mouth
was very dry.

He opened his eyes.  Maelcum's features were overlayed
with bands of translucent hieroglyphs.
`An'~ you medicine,' Maelcum said.  `Two derm.'
He was flat on his back on the library floor, below the
monitor.  The Zionite helped him sit up, but the movement

blue derms burning against his left wrist.  `Overdose,' he man-

The service cart was crying.  The betaphenethylamine gave
it a voice.  It wouldn't stop.  Not in the crowded gallery, the
long corridors, not as it passed the black glass entrance to the
T-A crypt, the vaults where the cold had seeped so gradually
into old Ashpool's dreams.

Mike: Oh, I'll just go wish myself into the cornfield. 

The transit was an extended rush for Case, the movement
of the cart indistinguishable from the insane momentum of the

overdose.  When the cart died, at last, something beneath the
seat giving up with a shower of white sparks, the crying stopped.
The thing coasted to a stop three meters from the start of
3Jane's pirate cave.
`How far, mon?'  Maelcum helped him from the sputtering

der.
The trodes rattled around Case's neck as he followed the
Zionite.  Riviera's holos waited for them, the torture scenes and
the cannibal children.  Molly had broken the triptych.  Maelcum
ignored them.

Crow: Stupid trees! God, I hate them.

`Easy,' Case said, forcing himself to catch up with the
striding figure.  `Gotta do this right.'
Maelcum halted, turned, glowering at him, the Remington
in his hands.  `Right, mon?  How's right?'
`Got Molly in there, but she's out of it.  Riviera, he can
throw holos.  Maybe he's got Molly's fletcher.'  Maelcum nod-

`She a warrior,' Maelcum said, as if it explained everything.
`Now you tell me, mon, who I _not_ t'~ kill.'
`3Jane,' he said, after a pause.  `A girl there.  Has a kinda
white robe thing on, with a hood.  We need her.'

When they reached the entrance, Maelcum walked straight
in, and Case had no choice but to follow him.
3Jane's country was deserted, the pool empty.  Maelcum
handed him the deck and the construct and walked to the edge

Servo: Hey, its the musical stairs from the science museum. 

of the pool.  Beyond the white pool furniture, there was dark-
ness, shadows of the ragged, waist-high maze of partially
demolished walls.
The water lapped patiently against the side of the pool.

Servo: Yeah! Yeah, and so you dig into your seat cushion and you find a really old peanut, and you're so bored you eat it! And then you just feel bad and a little sick, and then you think you're about to go! But-but then Aunt Ruth takes out a photo album filled with black-and-white photos of kids with squinty eyes and they're supposed to be your uncles and aunts or something, and then your parents force you to look at them!  

`They're here,' Case said.  `They gotta be.'
Maelcum nodded.
The first arrow pierced his upper arm.  The Remington roared,

its meter of muzzle-flash blue in the light from the pool.  The

second arrow struck the shotgun itself, sending it spinning
across the white tiles.  Maelcum sat down hard and fumbled at
the black thing that protruded from his arm.  He yanked at it.
Hideo stepped out of the shadows, a third arrow ready in a
slender bamboo bow.  He bowed.
Maelcum stared, his hand still on the steel shaft.
`The artery is intact,' the ninja said.  Case remembered
Molly's description of the man who'd killed her lover.  Hideo
was another.  Ageless, he radiated a sense of quiet, an utter
calm.  He wore clean, frayed khaki workpants and soft dark
shoes that fit his feet like gloves, split at the toes like tabi

socks.  The bamboo bow was a museum piece, but the black
alloy quiver that protruded above his left shoulder had the look
of the best Chiba weapons shops.  His brown chest was bare
and smooth.
`You cut my thumb, mon, wi'~ secon'~ one,' Maelcum said.

Pedro: What kind of food do they eat on earth, Santa?

`Coriolis force,' the ninja said, bowing again.  `Most dif-
ficult, slow-moving projectile in rotational gravity.  It was not
intended.'
`Where's 3Jane?'  Case crossed to stand beside Maelcum.

Mike: Pssh! He's talking about fragile shoulders.

He saw that the tip of the arrow in the ninja's bow was like a
double-edged razor.  `Where's Molly?'

Servo: Top Super-Duper Maxi-Extreme Ultra Secret. 

`Hello, Case.'  Riviera came strolling out of the dark behind
Hideo, Molly's fletcher in his hand.  `I would have expected
Armitage, somehow.  Are we hiring help out of that Rasta
cluster now?'
`Armitage is dead.'
`Armitage never existed, more to the point, but the news
hardly comes as a shock.'
`Wintermute killed him.  He's in orbit around the spindle.'

Servo: You're the worst party clown we ever had!...had...had... 

Riviera nodded, his long gray eyes glancing from Case to
Maelcum and back.  `I think it ends here, for you,' he said.
`Where's Molly?'
The ninja relaxed his pull on the fine, braided string, low-
ering the bow.  He crossed the tiles to where the Remington
lay and picked it up.  `This is without subtlety,' he said, as if
to himself.  His voice was cool and pleasant.  His every move
was part of a dance, a dance that never ended, even when his
body was still, at rest, but for all the power it suggested, there
was also a humility, an open simplicity.
`It ends here for her, too,' Riviera said.
`Maybe 3Jane won't go for that, Peter,' Case said, uncertain
of the impulse.  The derms still raged in his system, the old
fever starting to grip him, Night City craziness.  He remembered
moments of grace, dealing out on the edge of things, where
he'd found that he could sometimes talk faster than he could
think.
The gray eyes narrowed.  `Why, Case?  Why do you think
that?'
Case smiled.  Riviera didn't know about the simstim rig.

Crow: My Buns of Steel videos are in there! 

He'd missed it in his hurry to find the drugs she carried for
him.  But how could Hideo have missed it?  And Case was

decided, the ninja knew.  So 3Jane would know as well.
`Tell me, Case,' Riviera said, raising the pepperbox muzzle

of the fletcher.
Something creaked, behind him, creaked again.  3Jane pushed
Molly out of the shadows in an ornate Victorian bathchair, its
tall, spidery wheels squeaking as they turned.  Molly was bun-
dled deep in a red and black striped blanket, the narrow, caned
back of the antique chair towering above her.  She looked very
small.  Broken.  A patch of brilliantly white micropore covered

with the motion of the chair.
`A familiar face,' 3Jane said, `I saw you the night of Peter's
show.  And who is this?'
`Maelcum,' Case said.
`Hideo, remove the arrow and bandage Mr.~ Malcolm's
wound.'
Case was staring at Molly, at the wan face.
The ninja walked to where Maelcum sat, pausing to lay his
bow and the shotgun well out of reach, and took something
from his pocket.  A pair of bolt cutters.  `I must cut the shaft,'
he said.  `It is too near the artery.'  Maelcum nodded.  His face
was grayish and sheened with sweat.
Case looked at 3Jane.  `There isn't much time,' he said.
`For whom, exactly?'
`For any of us.'  There was a snap as Hideo cut through the
metal shaft of the arrow.  Maelcum groaned.
`Really,' Riviera said, `it won't amuse you to hear this

3Jane threw back her head and laughed.  `Wouldn't I, Pe-
ter?'
`The ghosts are gonna mix it tonight, lady,' Case said.
`Wintermute's going up against the other one, Neuromancer.
For keeps.  You know that?'
3Jane raised her eyebrows.  `Peter's suggested something
like that, but tell me more.'
`I met Neuromancer.  He talked about your mother.  I think

he's something like a giant ROM construct, for recording per-

like it's real, but it just goes on forever.'
3Jane stepped from behind the bathchair.  `Where?  Describe
the place, this construct.'

Servo: Watch Rando the Great construct sets with his very mind!

`A beach.  Gray sand, like silver that needs polishing.  And
a concrete thing, kinda bunker...'  He hesitated.  `It's nothing

back to where you started.'
`Yes,' she said.  `Morocco.  When Marie-France was a girl,
years before she married Ashpool, she spent a summer alone
on that beach, camping in an abandoned blockhouse.  She for-
mulated the basis of her philosophy there.'
Hideo straightened, slipping the cutters into his workpants.
He held a section of the arrow in either hand.  Maelcum had

Crow: Doctor Who... the hell cares!

his eyes closed, his hand clapped tight around his bicep.  `I
will bandage it,' Hideo said.
Case managed to fall before Riviera could level the fletcher
for a clear shot.  The darts whined past his neck like supersonic
gnats.  He rolled, seeing Hideo pivot through yet another step
of his dance, the razored point of the arrow reversed in his
hand, shaft flat along palm and rigid fingers.  He flicked it
underhand, wrist blurring, into the back of Riviera's hand.  The
fletcher struck the tiles a meter away.

Servo: That felt good... Now I'm going to turn my daughter into a woodchuck.

Riviera screamed.  But not in pain.  It was a shriek of rage,
so pure, so refined, that it lacked all humanity.
Twin tight beams of light, ruby red needles, stabbed from
the region of Riviera's sternum.
The ninja grunted, reeled back, hands to his eyes, then found
his balance.
`Peter,' 3Jane said, `Peter, what have you _done?'_
`He's blinded your clone boy,' Molly said flatly.
Hideo lowered his cupped hands.  Frozen on the white tile,
Case saw whisps of steam drift from the ruined eyes.

Crow: I hate to burst your bubble, Joel, but what about the bubonic plague? World Wars? Stalin?

Riviera smiled.
Hideo swung into his dance, retracing his steps.  When he
stood above the bow, the arrow, and the Remington, Riviera's
smile had faded.  He bent -- bowing, it seemed to Case -- and
found the bow and arrow.
`You're blind,' Riviera said, taking a step backward.
`Peter,' 3Jane said, `don't you know he does it in the dark?
Zen.  It's the way he practices.'

Mike: You're absolutely right! I am a terrible singer!

The ninja notched his arrow.  `Will you distract me with your
holograms now?'

Crow: Yeah, it's a pity we can't kill you and get away with it! 

Riviera was backing away, into the dark beyond the pool.
He brushed against a white chair; its feet rattled on the tile.
Hideo's arrow twitched.
Riviera broke and ran, throwing himself over a low, jagged
length of wall.  The ninja's face was rapt, suffused with a quiet
ecstasy.


Smiling, he padded off into the shadows beyond the wall,
his weapon held ready.
`Jane-lady,' Maelcum whispered, and Case turned, to see
him scoop the shotgun from the tiles, blood spattering the white
ceramic.  He shook his locks and lay the fat barrel in the crook
of his wounded arm.  `This take your head off, no Babylon
doctor fix it.'
3Jane stared at the Remington.  Molly freed her arms from
the folds of the striped blanket, raising the black sphere that
encased her hands.  `Off,' she said, `get it off.'
Case rose from the tiles, shook himself.  `Hideo'll get him,
even blind?' he asked 3Jane.
`When I was a child,' she said, `we loved to blindfold him.

Servo: Oh, I'm glad they said "Danger!", or I might have thought it was just a normal death ray.

He put arrows through the pips in playing cards at ten meters.'
`Peter's good as dead anyway,' Molly said.  `In another
twelve hours, he'll start to freeze up.  Won't be able to move,
his eyes is all.'
`Why?'  Case turned to her.
`I poisoned his shit for him,' she said.  `Condition's like

Servo: It's…

Parkinson's disease, sort of.'
3Jane nodded.  `Yes.  We ran the usual medical scan, before
he was admitted.'  She touched the ball in a certain way and
it sprang away from Molly's hands.  `Selective destruction of
the cells of the _substantia nigra._  Signs of the formation of a
Lewy body.  He sweats a great deal, in his sleep.'

Crow: Wall-mounted keyboards . . . it must be the future! 

`Ali,' Molly said, ten blades glittering, exposed for an
instant.  She tugged the blanket away from her legs, revealing

the inflated cast.  `It's the meperidine.  I had Ali make me up
a custom batch.  Speeded up the reaction times with higher
temperatures.  _N_-methyl-4-phenyl-1236,' she sang, like a child
reciting the steps of a sidewalk game, `tetra-hydro-pyridene.'

Joel: It stinks!

`A hotshot,' Case said.

Servo: Heh heh heh.

`Yeah,' Molly said, `a real slow hotshot.'

wound, but it obviously hurt him to carry her.  Her hip was
pressing the deck and construct into Case's kidneys.
They rose out of gravity, toward the axis, the cores.
The entrance to the elevator had been concealed beside the
stairs to the corridor, another touch in 3Jane's pirate cave decor.
`I don't suppose I should tell you this,' 3Jane said, craning
her head to allow her chin to clear the muzzle of the gun, `but

`Chubb lock,' Molly said, her voice muffled by Maelcum's

`That chip of yours still working?' Case asked her.

Lea: You bastard!

`It's eight twenty-five, PM, Greenwich fucking Mean,' she
said.
`We got five minutes,' Case said, as the door snapped open
behind 3Jane.  She flipped backward in a slow somersault, the
pale folds of her djellaba billowing around her thighs.
They were at the axis, the core of Villa Straylight.

The Flatline punched them up, smooth ascent, the ventral

glowed with a perfect reproduction of the keyboard of his deck.

`No, but I never cracked an AI, either.'

Crow: She'd say, "He's not mine! You can't prove it!" 

`Now your best _de_-fense, boy, it's a good _off_-fense.'
And the Flatline aligned the nose of Kuang's sting with the
center of the dark below.  And dove.
Case's sensory input warped with their velocity.
His mouth filled with an aching taste of blue.
His eyes were eggs of unstable crystal, vibrating with a
frequency whose name was rain and the sound of trains, sud-
denly sprouting a humming forest of hair-fine glass spines.  The
spines split, bisected, split again, exponential growth under the
dome of the Tessier-Ashpool ice.

And when he was nothing, compressed at the heart of all

and something tore.
The Kuang program spurted from tarnished cloud, Case's
consciousness divided like beads of mercury arcing above an
endless beach the color of the dark silver clouds.  His vision
was spherical, as though a single retina lined the inner surface
of a globe that contained all things, if all things could be
counted.
And here things could be counted, each one.  He knew the
number of grains of sand in the construct of the beach (a number

`Why?'
`Hoping I could bring you here as well, keep you here.  But

`So what now?'  He swung them back into the bank of cloud.
`Where do we go from here?'

Crow: I'm being turned on by a woman who is long dead! 

`I don't know, Case.  Tonight the very matrix asks itself
that question.  Because you have won.  You have already won,

fear and longing.  Beyond the freefall tangle of 3Jane's hair,

Kuang slid out of the clouds.  Below him, the neon city.
Behind him, a sphere of darkness dwindled.

He was alone.

Wintermute was hive mind, decision maker, effecting change

Wintermute.  Cold and silence, a cybernetic spider slowly
