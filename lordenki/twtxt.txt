2018-02-12T08:47:24-05:00	I keep hearing the awful take that Altered Carbon is shallow aesthetic-centric cyberpunk devoid of social commentary. Did these people rush to skim the book when they heard about the TV show or something?
2018-02-12T08:48:51-05:00	The first book in the Altered Carbon series hews closer to standard hardboiled structure & is less 'about' resleeving but is very much about social inequality at scale.
2018-02-12T08:50:23-05:00	The second and third books are mostly about the political & social ramifications of resleeving technology over centuries. That is, after all, the point of the series.
2018-02-12T08:52:18-05:00	I feel like Netflix's adaptation did a pretty good job of keeping that social & political focus, and even frontloading it a little bit by injecting backstory from the second and third books.
2018-02-12T08:54:00-05:00	People make the obvious comparison to Blade Runner, but seeing as how Blade Runner is a famously shallow & aesthetically-focused adaptation that strips the social & political elements from its source, Altered Carbon comes out the winner here

2018-02-12T15:31:28-05:00	Social structure is a technology, but it's one that most self-identified techies are ill-equipped to debug, mainly due to bigotry against properly studying it.
2018-02-12T15:32:56-05:00	We're really bad at being dispassionate about non-social technologies, but even worse about social technologies (by which I mean: political systems, power relations).
2018-02-12T15:34:17-05:00	Of course, being driven by emotion, nostalgia, and other prejudices is a non-issue in emacs vs vi. But, in deciding how to structure power relations, it's huge.
2018-02-12T15:36:41-05:00	In an equitable society, social problems are a matter of individual choice. We don't live in such a society, and never have. If we want to, we should be honest about this. Pretending to have achieved equity is a good way to amplify shitty power relations.
2018-02-12T15:38:47-05:00	Optimizing for anything other than human happiness seems like a recipe for misery. Of course, no existing political system really seriously attempts to optimize for human happiness.
2018-02-12T15:39:59-05:00	There are legitimate open questions: should we maximize minimum happiness? Should we maximize mean, or median, or total happiness? But, no existing social system optimizes for any of these metrics or any combination of them.
