2018-02-12T08:47:24-05:00	I keep hearing the awful take that Altered Carbon is shallow aesthetic-centric cyberpunk devoid of social commentary. Did these people rush to skim the book when they heard about the TV show or something?
2018-02-12T08:48:51-05:00	The first book in the Altered Carbon series hews closer to standard hardboiled structure & is less 'about' resleeving but is very much about social inequality at scale.
2018-02-12T08:50:23-05:00	The second and third books are mostly about the political & social ramifications of resleeving technology over centuries. That is, after all, the point of the series.
2018-02-12T08:52:18-05:00	I feel like Netflix's adaptation did a pretty good job of keeping that social & political focus, and even frontloading it a little bit by injecting backstory from the second and third books.
2018-02-12T08:54:00-05:00	People make the obvious comparison to Blade Runner, but seeing as how Blade Runner is a famously shallow & aesthetically-focused adaptation that strips the social & political elements from its source, Altered Carbon comes out the winner here

2018-02-12T15:31:28-05:00	Social structure is a technology, but it's one that most self-identified techies are ill-equipped to debug, mainly due to bigotry against properly studying it.
2018-02-12T15:32:56-05:00	We're really bad at being dispassionate about non-social technologies, but even worse about social technologies (by which I mean: political systems, power relations).
2018-02-12T15:34:17-05:00	Of course, being driven by emotion, nostalgia, and other prejudices is a non-issue in emacs vs vi. But, in deciding how to structure power relations, it's huge.
2018-02-12T15:36:41-05:00	In an equitable society, social problems are a matter of individual choice. We don't live in such a society, and never have. If we want to, we should be honest about this. Pretending to have achieved equity is a good way to amplify shitty power relations.
2018-02-12T15:38:47-05:00	Optimizing for anything other than human happiness seems like a recipe for misery. Of course, no existing political system really seriously attempts to optimize for human happiness.
2018-02-12T15:39:59-05:00	There are legitimate open questions: should we maximize minimum happiness? Should we maximize mean, or median, or total happiness? But, no existing social system optimizes for any of these metrics or any combination of them.

2018-06-06T13:56:39-04:00	I should probably implement an example version of transcopyright for my repo of 'important data structures, algorithms, & ideas that have no easily-understood isolated example implementations' (https://github.com/enkiv2/misc/tree/master/ds-lib) since it's already mostly xanadu shit
2018-06-06T14:06:06-04:00	Actually, if I did a series of articles on (non-secret parts of) Xanadu internals, would anybody care? Not just transcopyright -- I've got detailed knowledge on how ZZOGL / FloatingWord did layout, for instance. I think I can explain these things in a clearer way than Ted does, in some cases.

2018-06-25T09:02:31-04:00	Hot take: the more powerful you are, the harder people under you will work to save you from your bad choices, & the harder they'll avoid actually addressing those problems. A perfect storm for inflated confidence: your continued success is owed to the people covering your ass, but you attribute it even more to yourself.

The best of today's programming languages make easy things hard and hard things harder. We don't have a system that makes easy things easy and hard things merely hard for backwards-compatibility reasons.

2018-08-16T14:31:20-04:00	This is a very hot take and also not a new one but here we go: the goal of a properly functioning software engineer is to obviate themselves, not by solving the customer's specific problems but by blurring the line between using a computer and programming one to the point where users can solve their own problems.

2018-08-17T19:01:46-04:00	VLC logic: doubleclick toggles fullscreen but each single click in that double click still also toggles playback, so toggling fullscreen causes you play for 1/8 of a second
2018-08-17T20:25:51-04:00	Translit is a little like bittorrent, if bittorrent used literally the same bytes for AMVs and trailers as for the corresponding scenes in the show/movie.

2018-10-30T13:26:39-04:00	Hot take: any command that a user might want to use regularly should be short, memorable, and built-in; any command that a user might really NEED to use should be documented & included in the examples in built-in documentation.
2018-10-30T13:29:09-04:00	Hot take: in the absence of full information, provide reasonable defaults that are easily overridden. Making users repeat normally-identical pieces of information several times just because they CAN differ in a corner case is bad design.
2018-10-30T16:51:33-04:00	Hot take: moral hazard is an information problem with its roots in systematic overconfidence & optimism bias. Either important domains of risk are ignored or the effectiveness of mitigations is overestimated.

2018-10-31T13:17:42-04:00	'Do you prefer horror movies or comedy movies' is a good way of phrasing 'with what degree of intensity are you comfortable having your mental constructs challenged'. 'Hausu is my favorite movie' is a valid & illuminating response.
2018-10-31T13:21:21-04:00	In one sense, 'the computer revolution is over' because the period of exponential growth behind the tech ended 10 years ago. In another sense, it hasn't begun: we have sheltered ourselves from the social and intellectual ramifications of computing. Documents are still simulations of paper, & capitalism still exists. So it's like that period where printing presses existed but everybody used a faux-calligraphic font.

2019-03-10T20:10:43-04:00	Other ways in which UX is like stand-up comedy: if you omit the setup, the punchline won't land; reading the room is a vital skill
2019-03-10T20:13:04-04:00	The typical failure mode of UX is no longer the shaggy-dog story (i.e., the turing tarpit: a lot of build-up for a disappointing conclusion); it's bunch of shallow one-liners with no connecting thread, which are as funny as they can be for their length but don't make the most of a set.
2019-03-10T20:15:08-04:00	A good user interface *is* a lot like a standup routine: you take the deep knowledge of an audience and twist it in creative ways so that they now understand something they couldn't have imagined on their own.
2019-03-10T20:16:15-04:00	Poor documentation is overrated as an attribute of jokes. (Some of my favorite jokes are literally humorous attempts at explaining other jokes.) The difference between standup comedy & UI design is even bad comics know this.

2019-03-15T08:57:05-04:00	Trendism is the idea that, in Dellio's White Noise, when people photograph the Most Photographed Barn In America, they are not acting absurdly but creating net value for society.
2019-03-15T08:58:52-04:00	Trendism is the logic of financialized speculative capitalism extended to the realm of takes: information about information about information (even if it's false) exceeds the value of the baseline information.
2019-03-15T09:00:08-04:00	Trendism is the logic of the Spectacle applied recursively: the image doesn't matter, but whether or not the appearance of its appearance appears is worth arbitrary millions.
2019-03-15T09:01:48-04:00	Trendism is a complicated inversion of the aphorism 'mediocre minds talk about people, and great minds talk about ideas': we value most those who talk about whether or not people are talking about an idea.

2019-04-03T13:37:46-04:00	What's the difference between poetry and prose? I'd say that with prose, one aims to constrain the set of possible meanings as tightly as possible to minimize misunderstanding. Poetry has the richness of possible meanings that direct experience has.
2019-04-03T13:39:15-04:00	If one intends to be understood, one must be careful not to be too clever: a reader will calibrate their cleverness based on their expectation of yours, & any mismatch is liable to produce misunderstanding.
2019-04-03T13:41:05-04:00	A depiction, if rich enough to be interesting, is bound to have internally contradictory potential interpretations. You control the frame, but the frame can't be as tight as in (say) an essay.

I'll bet heavy command line users tend to prefer subs for exactly this reason.
