Instead, the ‘loss of the open web’ is an eternal september situation: most contributors to the content of the web were no longer people who had the time &amp; money to buy their own domains &amp; host off their own machines.</p><p name="68be" id="68be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s still a problem, and the problem does not lay at the feet of the influx of new users. Everybody in 1990 should have been able to see that by 2000 lots of people would be online and the people who were up for buying a domain name would be the same ones who had one in 1990.</p><p name="9cf7" id="9cf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of making it easy for people to host things on their own machines &amp; optimizing for inconsistent connections in the dialup era, we took the easy way out &amp; relied on ISPs to host user content. That seemed OK because we were doing the same thing with usenet back then. We never really fixed this as the dailup era ended.</p><p name="f5ff" id="f5ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, we’re addressing this a bit now with IPFS and DAT and similar things. But, it might be too late. Already, hosting content is “something that nerds do” and “something that big companies do”, never “something that I can do” from the perspective of non-technical users.</p><p name="2efd" id="2efd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Everybody has a browser cache &amp; so it’s pretty stupid that we don’t have cache sharing along bittorrent or something built into every major browser and turned on by default. Like, we could have done that in 1995 (not with bittorrent but just with full-file hashing or something, among users with the same ISP, with the ISP coordinating). Federated peer-to-peer cache contents sharing is a lot easier to gradually transform into a hostless fully distributed storage thing. Instead, when ATT WorldNet stopped hosting our home pages we turned to geocities, and when geocities stopped we went to MySpace.</p></div></div></section>
