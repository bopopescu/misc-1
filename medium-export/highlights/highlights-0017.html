Literacy of any kind is a beautiful thing. In today’s market, demand for code-literate employees far exceeds the supply, so engineering teams contain both hackers and non-hackers. Increasingly, the latter outnumber the former. This is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">still</em> a beautiful thing — until the latter realise there are enough of them to push the weirdoes out, and do it.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-03-22 2:43 pm</time> - <p name="220a" id="220a" class="graf graf--p">…dentally strong enough to protect credit card numbers in transit, and suddenly e-commerce exploded. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">The smell of wealth attracts the power-hungry and the job-hungry like raw meat does flies, and two bubbles later, the pull is still as strong as ever. (It’s as if there’s some fundamental human drive to communicate or something.) Successive waves of subcultural immigration into the tech industry have brought with them a myriad of social signaling dialects. Without active effort, it’s easy to miss that between two techies, one signifier can easily have three or more meanings, depending entirely on how the people involved got to where they are.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-03-22 2:45 pm</time> - <p name="dc9a" id="dc9a" class="graf graf--p">…ckers, just the same as can be said for women, bisexuals, Texans, or engineers who aren’t hackers.

Some hackers even argue for greater exclusivity, and curiously enough, many of those who do are also members of minority-by-birth groups. (I’d link to examples, but being caught between a minority-by-choice group and a minority-by-birth group means being extra careful about expressing unpopular opinions where anyone unsympathetic can hear you.) We’re outsiders, even if we’re outsiders with power, and we’re hyper-aware of the qualities that cause us to be treated as outsiders in the first place.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-03-22 2:47 pm</time> - <p name="c2db" id="c2db" class="graf graf--p">…what both brogrammers and geek feminists are after as well — a culture where they feel comfortable? <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Why is the onus on the outsiders who built our own spaces to understand the insider-newcomers, and not the other way around, particularly when the insiders are the ones colonising us?</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-03-22 2:49 pm</time> - <p name="2bd3" id="2bd3" class="graf graf--p">…hat desire and the fear that ultimately nothing will really change.

How else do you expect someone to recognize the seriousness of what they’re doing to themselves? <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">There’s something to that, but it captures the central conceit of a dangerous assumption we seem to have made as a culture these days: that being right is a license to be a total, unrepentant asshole. After all, why would you need to repent if you haven’t committed the ultimate sin of being wrong? Some say there’s no reason to care about other people’s feelings if the facts are on your side.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-03-25 12:38 pm</time> - <p name="58cc" id="58cc" class="graf graf--p">… look back at some of my own writing, I see versions of that same mistake Jeff Bezos made as a kid. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">I thought if I was just overwhelmingly right enough, people would listen. If I humiliated my opponent, they would have to admit I was right and they were wrong. I’ve even said in interviews that the goal of my first book was to rip back the curtain on how media really works so people could not turn away. But guess what? A lot of people still did.

While the American women did play a role in assisting Japanese women, it must be noted that their roles in inspiring Japanese women to fight for their rights is greatly overstated, practically wiping out the hard work of pre-war Japanese feminists such as Kimura Komako.</span> Months before MacArthur met with Japanese officials to discuss female suffrage, notable feminist Ic…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-04-2 11:28 am</time> - <p name="2f29" id="2f29" class="graf graf--p"><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Female sexuality was also exploited and explored during this time like never before.

W.G.
