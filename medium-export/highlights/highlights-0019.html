With its development, the tyranny of top-down broadcast media seemed to be broken by the peer-to-peer connections and free expressions of every human node on the network. The net turned media back into a collective, participatory, and social landscape</span>.</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-11-7 2:13 pm</time> - <p name="a6fe" id="a6fe" class="graf graf--p">…hen they are not developing interfaces to control us, they are building intelligence to replace us. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Any of these technologies could be steered toward extending our human capabilities and collective power.

Human beings evolved by gaining the capacity to forge greater numbers of social connections. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">The development of our brain, language, text, electronic media, and digital networks were all driven by our need for higher levels of social organization. The net — just the latest of these advances — challenges us with the possibility that thinking and memory may not be personal at all, but group activities. But this potential has been overshadowed by deep suspicion of how human beings might behave as an empowered collective, as well as a growing awareness that socially fulfilled people need less money, experience less shame, behave less predictably, and act more autonomously.</span></p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-11-7 2:15 pm</time> - <p name="54f6" id="54f6" class="graf graf--p">…re nuanced. Even according to Watts’ own analysis, the results were at least a partial replication: <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">When the new dataset was initially analyzed, it still showed that waiting longer for a marshmallow predicted better academic performance in later life. On the other hand, the fact that the effect disappeared after accounting for home environment and cognitive ability suggested that the way the original marshmallow test results were embraced was overzealous.</span> Watts didn’t think his study should be lumped into the larger replication crisis, but said his work…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-11-7 2:16 pm</time> - <p name="a1f8" id="a1f8" class="graf graf--p">…ucial factors that contribute to a person’s ability to resist immediate gratification. For example, <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">in his study, Watts minimized the effect of a psychological trait called executive function — a mental process that’s involved in suppressing impulses. His reasoning was that this trait reflects a child’s general cognitive ability, and could be the real reason why patient kids do better socially and academically. But Doebel argues that children may need this skill in order to resist a tempting marshmallow, so ruling it out may also rule out any relevance of the marshmallow test altogether</span>.</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-11-7 2:17 pm</time> - <p name="5852" id="5852" class="graf graf--p">…e difficulties as adolescents, even after accounting for some other important childhood influences. <span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection">Based on the results in their paper, the marshmallow test may predict outcomes primarily because of social support rather than self-control: Children growing up in more supportive and trusting environments may be more willing to wait for rewards.</span> This converges with some of Watts’ arguments about the importance of a child’s environment in expla…</p></li><li class="h-entry"><time class="dt-published">2019-11-7 2:25 pm</time> - <p name="d0a3" id="d0a3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“</em><span class="markup--highlight"  name="selection"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">A big reason why I started writing is I felt that fiction had stopped evolving. All other entertainments were getting better, constantly, as technology allowed. Movies. Video games. Music. And as their audiences became more sophisticated, these other media could experiment and risk trying new storytelling methods. The bright future is that readers are accepting more varied forms of stories.
