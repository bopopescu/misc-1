	Much as in The Bling Ring, where: 
		Quiet teenager Marc Hall (Israel Broussard) arrives as a new student at Indian Hills High School in Agoura Hills, California.
		He is befriended by fame-obsessed Rebecca Ahn (Katie Chang).
		While at a party at Rebecca's house, the pair check unlocked vehicles on the street, taking valuables such as cash and credit cards.
		When Marc mentions that one of his wealthy acquaintances is out of town, Rebecca persuades him to join her in breaking into to his house.
		Rebecca steals a handbag, mentioning that her idol, Lindsay Lohan, has the same one.
		She also steals cash and the keys to a Porsche, which the pair use to flee the scene.
		With the cash, the two go on a shopping spree, affording themselves the luxury lifestyle they admire in magazines.
		Marc visits a nightclub with Rebecca and her friends Nicki (Emma Watson), Nicki's adopted sister Sam (Taissa Farmiga), and Chloe (Claire Julien), where they rub shoulders with celebrities such as Kirsten Dunst and Paris Hilton.
		While researching Hilton on the Internet, Marc and Rebecca realize that she will be out of town.
		The pair go to her house, and finding the key under the doormat, they go through Hilton's belongings, taking some jewelry.
		Rebecca then flaunts a stolen bracelet to Nicki, Sam, and Chloe at a party.
		At Nicki's request, Rebecca and Marc take her, Sam and Chloe back to Hilton's house.
		The group marvels at the excess of Hilton's lifestyle, and steals shoes, bags, dresses, cash, and jewelry.
		Marc and Rebecca return to rob Hilton's house on a third occasion.
		The pair also decides to rob the home of Audrina Patridge, once again using the Internet to determine when she will not be home.
		The entire group uses the same method to burgle the home of Megan Fox, with Nicki's younger sister Emily (Georgia Rock) squeezing through a pet door to gain access to the home.
		The group enters the home of Orlando Bloom and his girlfriend, Miranda Kerr.
		The girls proceed to steal similar items, while Marc finds a case filled with seven of Bloom's Rolex watches along with a roll of cash.
		Chloe then helps Marc sell the watches to her friend, a night club manager named Ricky (Gavin Rossdale).
		The group returns once again to Hilton's house, with Sam's boyfriend Rob (Carlos Miranda), who also steals from the home.
		A news report releases captured CCTV footage from the robbery at Patridge's home.
		This concerns Marc, but Rebecca is undeterred and instigates a burglary at the home of Rachel Bilson.
		Word spreads amongst the group's social circles, and the girls boast of their accomplishments at parties, also posting photographs of the stolen items on social media sites.
		The group ultimately breaks into Lohan's house and robs it.
		Shortly after, Rebecca moves to Las Vegas with her father due to troubles at home, leaving some of her stolen items with Marc, who inadvertently helps Rebecca transfer stolen items across state lines.
		News reports of the Hollywood Hills burglaries intensify, with the media labeling the group "The Bling Ring".
		CCTV from several robberies in addition to the evidence on social media allows authorities to identify the group.
		Police arrest Marc, Nicki, Chloe, Rebecca, Rob, and Ricky, but Sam is not identified in the footage and avoids arrest.
		Marc cooperates with the police, informing them on the details of the burglaries, much to the chagrin of Rebecca, who has been identified as the ringleader.
		A Vanity Fair journalist interviews Marc, who is remorseful, and Nicki, who vehemently suggests the others were at fault, and that she was simply involved with the wrong people.
		Rebecca also denies being at fault and tries to pass the blame for all of this to Marc and her other friends.
		The group is ultimately prosecuted, receiving varying amounts of jail time and is ordered to collectively pay millions of dollars in restitution for the stolen items.
		The group serves their jail time, and Marc and Rebecca each go into seclusion from the press.
		They never see or speak to each other again, and both of them steadfastly blame each other for the robberies.
		In the final scene, set a few months later, Nicki is on a talk show talking about her time in jail, and reveals that her cell was next to Lohan's.
		After digressing, she turns to the audience (and the viewers) as she finds a way to enhance her newfound notoriety, telling them to visit her now-popular website detailing her life after "The Bling Ring".
 accompany him to the
	Much as in Ghosts (Banville novel), where: 
		The novel is somewhat unconventional and non-linear in its construction.
		It begins with a group of travelers disembarking on a small island in the Irish Sea after their ship runs aground.
		There they stumble upon a house inhabited by Professor Kreutznaer, his assistant Licht, and an unnamed character who figures centrally in the novel and who is referred to only as "Little God".
		It is later revealed that Little God can be identified with Freddie Montgomery, the narrator of The Book of Evidence.
		Much of the latter half of the book focuses on Montgomery's account of his experiences after having been released from prison, his reflections on the crime (the murder of a young woman) he committed, and his continuing struggle with the ghosts of his past and the nature of his perceptions.
		Kreutznaer's relationship to a painting entitled The Golden World by a fictional Dutch artist named Vaublin plays a central role in the novel.
		The fictional painting is based to a large extent on The Embarkation for Cythera by Watteau.
		The narrator mentions "Cythera" several times and, to a certain degree, the characters are modelled on those in the painting.
		It is revealed that Kreutznaer and one of the travellers a man named Felix are acquainted with one another, and that Felix had been involved in art forgery.
		The novel ends with the travellers re-embarking and leaving the island, with many of the central issues and tensions left unresolved.

	Much as in Battle Royale (film), where: 
		Japanese middle school student Shuya Nanahara copes with life after his father's suicide.
		Meanwhile, schoolmate Noriko Nakagawa is the only student attending class 3-B.
		Their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being impulsively attacked by a student.
		One year later, class 3-B takes a field trip, but they are gassed, fitted with electronic collars, and sent to a "briefing room" on a remote island.
		Kitano explains that the class has been chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school.
		A cheerful orientation video instructs the class they have three days to kill each other until only one remains.
		The explosive collars will kill any uncooperative students or those within daily "danger zones".
		Kitano kills two students, Fumiyo Fujiyoshi and Yoshitoki Kuninobu (Shuya's best friend), for misbehavior during the video.
		Each student is provided a bag of food and water, map of the island, compass, and a weapon ranging in efficiency from firearms to a paper fan.
		The first six hours see twelve deaths, four by suicide.
		Mitsuko Souma and mute transfer student Kazuo Kiriyama soon become the most dangerous players.
		Another transfer student, Shogo Kawada, seems somewhat more merciful, and Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the military's computer system.
		Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe, because his friend secretly loved her.
		Shuya carries Noriko to a clinic after she collapses, where they encounter Kawada, who reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, whose death he seeks to avenge.
		When Kiriyama attacks, Shuya entrusts Kawada to protect Noriko and runs off as a distraction.
		Although saved by Hiroki Sugimura, he is wounded.
		Shuya awakens in the island's lighthouse, bandaged by female class representative Yukie Utsumi, who has a crush on him.
		Five other girls from her clique have also been hiding out in the building, including Yuko Sakaki, who attempts to poison Shuya only for another girl to accidentally eat the food.
		Yuko is the only survivor of the ensuing shootout; despondent, she apologises to Shuya and commits suicide.
		Shuya returns to Noriko and Kawada, and they set out to find Mimura.
		Of the seven students remaining, all except Kiriyama are attempting or willing to subvert the game.
		Mimura and two others, Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima, infiltrate the military's computer system, but Kiriyama finds and kills them.
		When Kawada, Noriko and Shuya arrive at the hackers' burning base, Kawada confronts and kills Kiriyama, who had been blinded by an explosion rigged by Mimura as he was killed.
		On the morning of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' internal microphones, takes Shuya and Noriko aside and fakes their deaths.
		Suspicious, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops, intent on personally killing the supposed victor.
		Kitano realizes that Kawada had hacked into the game's system months beforehand, and has now disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices.
		The three survivors confront Kitano in the headquarters, and he unveils a disturbing homemade painting of the massacred class that depicts Noriko as sole survivor.
		He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter.
		He confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter and asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots Kitano after he threatens Noriko with a gun.
		As he falls, Kitano shoots, revealing the gun to be a water gun.
		As he dies, Kitano angrily takes a call from his daughter and rebukes her.
		Shuya, Noriko and Kawada leave the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from injuries sustained in his gunfight with Kiriyama, happy that in the end, he "found true friends".
		Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitive murderers, and are last seen on the run in the direction of Tokyo's Shibuya train station.
		Noriko gives Shuya a Seto Dragon Claw balisong butterfly knife before they run off together.

		Vetrivel (Satyaraj) is a businessman who lives with his wife (Kushboo Sundar), his son Sakthivel (Sibiraj), his daughter Selvi (Bharathi) and his wife's brother Thandapani (Vadivelu).
		Sakthi wanted to become as an IPS officer but his father denied it and made him work in his shop.
		Selvi gets married and lives happily, while Sakthi falls in love with Manju (Nikita Thukral).
		It turns out that Manju is the daughter of Vetrivel's sister who eloped with someone.
		Since, Vetrivel has lost touch with his sister.
		Manju came into their lives to reunite the siblings.
		Meanwhile, Sakthi's sister finds out that her father-in-law (Thambi Ramaiah), his wife and her husband are culprits and smugglers.
		Before she can tell someone about it she is killed and her child is kept.
		Sakthi goes to visit his sister and finds her dead.
		Sakthi takes vengeance on his sister's murderers and goes to jail, while Manju's mother reunites with her brother Vetrivel.

		During these events, as the lower-class is fighting for certain causes, a group of privileged Yale alumni meet for a dance.
's antics during the
	Much as in Qayamat: City Under Threat, where: 
		The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has assigned the case of three terrorists to Akram Sheikh (Sunil Shetty).
		The three terrorists are two brothers Ali and Abbas Ramani (Sanjay Kapoor and Arbaaz Khan) and their common girlfriend Laila (Isha Koppikar).
		As a part of a plan hitched by a corrupt Pakistani general, Ali, Abbas and Laila hitch a plan to extort money from the Indian government.
		They take control of Elphinston Jail, in the city of Mumbai and using the help of a corrupt scientist, Gopal (Chunky Pandey) (a part of a team headed by Rahul (Aashish Chaudhary), investigating the effects of a deadly virus which could kill any living organism within a 3-kilometer radius), they load three missiles with the virus.
		They then take a group of 213 tourists hostage in the jail and demand a ransom of 1500 crores from the government within 24 hours, failing which they will release the missile into major water bodies in Mumbai, thus creating an apocalypse (Qayamat).
		Akram asks the Chief Minister to allow him to release Rachit (Ajay Devgan), a man who has previous experience of escaping from Elphinston Jail, a feat which has never been accomplished in history, to get help in entering the jail, through the very route which he had used to escape.
		Rachit is a man who has been silent for a long time now, owing to the fact that the love of his life, Sapna (Neha Dhupia) was killed the night he was arrested.
		The main point of note here was that Rachit was an associate of Ali and Abbas and had been double crossed by them, leading to his arrest.
		In turn, they had killed Sapna.
		However, unknown to Rachit, she was still alive.
		Akram and his team, which includes Rahul use all the help, they can to enter the jail through, first, an underwater route, and then a maze of tunnels through which Rachit had escaped.
		they successfully get to the septic tank of the jail but a mole in the CBI gives the news of the team's arrival to Ali and Abbas, whose men kill the whole team in a brutal gunfight, resulting in Akram's death as well.
		Rahul and Rachit are the only ones that are alive.
		Rachit suffers from severe mental trauma, the effects of which can be seen every 12 hours, whereby he starts hallucinating and sees odd shadows everywhere.
		He has even lost his power of speech due to this.
		These effects are taken away, when Sapna, who is now at the CBI headquarters, calls him on a walkie-talkie and assures him of her true love and the fact that she is indeed alive.
		This is enough for Rachit as he gets up and single-handedly takes out all of Ali and Abbas's men, one by one.
		Meanwhile, Rahul is also able to disarm the missiles one by one.
		However, while Rachit is taking out some more of the men, Ali gets to the last missile and tries to release it.
		Laila captures Rahul on gun point saying she will kill Rahul if Rachit does not leave Abbas.
		Rahul asks Rachit to let him die, but, Rachit shoots Rahul in the leg.
		Rahul falls down and Rachit shoots Laila in the head.
		Laila dies.
		Rahul disarms the missile and kills Ali after firing the rocket straight at him.
		Thus, the city is saved in the nick of time.
		At the end of the film, Rachit reunites with Sapna and reveals that he can talk.

	Much as in Asterix and the Big Fight, where: 
		The Romans having been humiliated many times by the rebel Gauls, Felonius Caucus, advisor to Centurion Nebulus Nimbus, suggests a single combat between Vitalstatistix, chief of Asterix s tribe, and the Gallo-Roman Chief, Cassius Ceramix of Linoleum.
		According to ancient Gaulish customs, the loser would forfeit his entire tribe to the winner.
		When Ceramix argues that Vitalstatistix would surely win with Getafix  magic potion of invincibility, Caucus sends a patrol to capture Getafix before the challenge is made.
		To scatter the attackers, Obelix accidentally strikes Getafix with a menhir, the impact of which causes amnesia and insanity.
		Following Cassius Ceramix' challenge, Asterix and Vitalstatistix attempt to restore Getafix s mind by experimenting in potions; but this produces only a whimsical sub-plot, in which the Roman soldier 'Informofpurpus', captured by Obelix as a test subject, is temporarily rendered weightless.
		Thereafter Asterix and Obelix consult Psychoanalytix (original French name is Amnesix), a druid who specializes in mental disorders; but when asked to demonstrate what caused the problem, Obelix crushes Psychoanalytix with a menhir, leaving Psychoanalytix "in the same state as Getafix".
		As the two crazed druids concoct a number of skin-coloring magic potions, Asterix tries to get Vitalstatistix into good physical shape for the fight, mainly by jogging.
		Meanwhile, the Romans plan to arrest Cassius after the fight, lest he thereafter challenge their control of Gaul.
		As the fight begins, Getafix accidentally makes a potion which restores his mind, and retains sanity despite being hit by another menhir (thrown by Obelix in an attempt to cure Getafix by repeating the cause of the original accident).
		Getafix quickly proceeds to brew a supply of magic potion.
		Meanwhile, the fight had turned into a bore: Vitalstatistix, exploiting his superior physical condition, is running circles around the ring while Ceramix tries in vain to catch him.
		After hearing of Getafix's recovery, Vitalstatistix defeats his exhausted opponent with a single blow.
		The Romans do not accept this victory, but are crushed by the Gauls, who had drunk Getafix's magic potion.
		When Ceramix is reduced to amnesia by a third menhir that was thrown by Obelix during the battle, Vitalstatistix declines his right to take over Cassius' tribe, and sends him home in honour.
		Psychoanalytix returns to business despite his amnesia, but remains professionally successful despite "side effects" of his medicines.
		Cassius, now in the same mental state as Psychoanalytix, becomes "the most courteous chief in Gaul" and the probable originator of French courtesy.
		His tribe returns to Gaulish ways and the fight against Rome, while Vitalstatistix's tribe celebrate their victories.
 attention away from Jack's embarrassment and
	Much as in River's End (1930 film), where: 
		In remote northern Canada, Sergeant Conniston (Bickford) seeks to capture escaped convicted murderer Keith (also played by Bickford).
		He is accompanied by O'Toole (J.
		Farrell MacDonald), a guide who is constantly drunk.
		When he finally catches his quarry, he is shocked to find that they look exactly alike.
		On their way back to the RCMP post, however, their sled overturns.
		Keith takes Conniston's gun and sled and leaves the policeman and his guide to die in the snow.
		Keith starts to feel guilty about what he has done.
		He turns back and takes the men to an emergency cabin.
		In spite of this, Conniston dies of a frozen lung.
		After talking to Keith for a while, O'Toole becomes convinced of his innocence.
		He coaches Keith so that he can pass himself off as the sergeant.
		O'Toole is not well enough to travel, so Keith goes to the RCMP post alone.
		Once he arrives, Keith tells McDowell (David Torrence), the post commanding officer, that it was Keith who died.
		McDowell then informs him that Keith was innocent; the real murderer confessed.
		Worried that he will be accused of Conniston's murder if his true identity is discovered, Keith plans to escape across the border.
		There are complications.
		Miriam (Evalyn Knapp), McDowell's daughter, had been Conniston's girl, but she decided to break up with him.
		Keith is very much attracted to her, and proves to be much more romantic than Conniston.
		Miriam finds herself falling in love with him.
		Mickey (Frank Coghlan, Jr), O'Toole's young son, had adopted Conniston as a substitute father.
		He eventually realizes that Keith is not the sergeant, but Keith manages to persuade him to keep his secret.
		Keith goes to see McDowell to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage, only to discover that a jealous rival had made inquiries.
		Conniston, it turns out, was married.
		McDowell orders him to leave the base in disgrace.
		Before he goes, he confesses the truth to Miriam.
		Then, refusing to sneak away, Keith braves a beating from a gauntlet of angry Mounties and boards a ship, accompanied by Mickey.
		At the last  minute, Miriam boards as well.
 finally
	Much as in Room V, where: 
		This is an instrumental track.
		The story begins where it was left off.
		Eight hours later, the Man is still running and hiding from the government and searching for his "lover".
		This song is as fast as the song "Chased" from Tyranny.
		The fourth quarter of the song resurrects the piano melody from "Christmas Day", as the time is still Christmas.
		"Manhunt" ends with a calmed section like "Chased".
		At last, the Man joins his lover (portrayed, again, by Laura Jaeger).
		Both are tired of running and hiding, but they realize how comfortable and safe they feel when they're together, and believe their.
		So, they promise one another to be always together.
		Her journal reveals her past.
		She was previously working on a cure for a weaponized version of smallpox.
		She used her own DNA to create a serum that can cure it.
		However, she stumbled on evidence that her employer wanted to cause a small outbreak of the disease to drive up demand for the serum before they release it.
		She stole the formula, sabotaged her work and ran away from them, putting her in the situation she was in at the start of Tyranny.
		The title of this track is a clear reference to the book The Andromeda Strain, although it is not based on the book itself.
		Soon the Man proposes to her, and the two get married, hoping to forget their past lives.
		This is the second instrumental track and, as its title implies, the Woman has given birth to a daughter named Alaska.
		The song builds towards a brief moment of calm, happy ambience as Alaska is born.
		This is the third instrumental, and the sequel to the previous track.
		It opens with a sudden mood change from happy to dark, and the sound of a heart monitor which soon flatlines, leading into a chaotic instrumental that ends with wrenching guitar solos.
		As its title points, the Woman has died in childbirth, leaving the Man alone with his daughter.
		The Man is broken, as his wife promised she would never leave during "Comfort Me", but she left so soon.
		The vocal arrangement is identical to "Comfort Me" as the Man remembers this broken promise.
		He claims that she is in the hands of God, while he must live in this world.
		This is the fourth instrumental, and as its title indicates, seven years have passed since the Woman's death.
		The Man's daughter has grown healthy.
		The mood is lush and innocent.
		This is the fifth and final instrumental.
		The peaceful life of the Man changes as a shattering window and a very high pitched scream is heard.
		Beside the scream, it can be heard that the word "daddy" is shouted twice.
		The remainder of the piece is dark ambience.
		The Man enters the room, only to find out that Alaska was kidnapped, and all of his emotions are let loose.
		He says he never heard the scream, and starts to curse the kidnappers.
		He wonders himself if he can ever escape from his past.
		Although he knows it is likely that the culprit is the New World Order, who would have staged the kidnapping to draw the Man out, his daughter is the only thing that matters in his life now.
		In the early morning the Man heads out into the forest determined to bring Alaska back alive, but he sees a soldier with a crossbow aimed at him.
		The Archer (portrayed by Carl Cadden-James), from a specialS.
		Special Forces segment fighting the New World Order (who chased the Man previously on Tyranny), has come with news.
		He reveals that the smallpox virus is in the wrong hands, and that they have tried to recreate the serum, but they haven't achieved it.
		So the Archer reveals that he also carries the same rare blood his wife had, implying Alaska has this blood too, and that her blood is essential to create a vaccine.
		The Archer also reveals that the Man's wife didn't die naturally, but she was killed by Mossad, the Intelligence from Israel, to steal blood from her (from the baby; they stole some blood from the Woman's womb).
		The Archer discloses that the New World Order organization is behind all this, and thatS.
		Special Forces have a key mission for the Man to perform.
		The Archer takes the Man to a well hidden town, to the back room of a library.
		Here the Man works on the serum, shaping encrypted lines, as the Archer stands guard.
		It is here that he discovers that the NWO is planning to unleash the plague, and sell the serums to those fortunate enough to pay the high fees for it.
		When the Man has finished, a scientist takes the disc and nods his head.
		It is also revealed that the codeword and keyword for the serum are "Room V" and "Tyranny" respectively; the Man uses this information to organize a resistance.
		The Man forms a band of six members, which are actually Shadow Gallery themselves (in an act of breaking the fourth wall), and it is implied that Mike Baker is equivalent to the Man.
		They write the serum key into Tyranny and Room V, knowing that because of Shadow Gallery's underground status, they can deliver the serum to the world without the New World Order knowing about it.
		A brief binary code is listed in the album booklet to the left of the song lyrics.
		The listeners are urged to join the resistance themselves by supporting Shadow Gallery.
		A five-minute jam session ends the song and fades into the sound of rain.
		As the Man has finished his work with theS.
		Special Forces, he continues to search for his lost daughter within the woods of Alaska.
		His entire mission may have saved the world, but it also has destroyed everything he has ever lived for   hence the metaphor "Their antidote is poison".
		He is tired of this world and this life, and begs to his dead wife for her shelter.
		It is implied that the Man may have died at the end, but his ultimate fate and that of Alaska's is left open-ended.

		Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot follows the generally harmless misadventures of a lovable, gauche Frenchman, Monsieur Hulot (played by Tati himself), as he joins the "newly emerging holiday-taking classes" for a summer vacation at a modest seaside resort.
		The film affectionately lampoons several hidebound elements of French political and economic classes, from chubby capitalists and self-important Marxist intellectuals to petty proprietors and drab dilettantes, most of whom find it nearly impossible to free themselves, even temporarily, from their rigid social roles in order to relax and enjoy life.
		The film also gently mocks the confidence of postwar western society in the optimistic belief in capitalist production, and the value of complex technology over simple pleasures, themes that would resurface in his later films.

		He returns after independence and unites with his wife.
		Present day, When krishnaswamy tries to arrest Senapathy, he escapes with his expertise in Varma kalai.
		Senapathy then goes on to commit a murder in front of television audiences by killing a corrupt doctor (Nizhalgal Ravi) who refused to attend immediately to Senapathy's daughter (Kasthuri), who was suffering from third degree burns because he insisted on a bribe, which Senapathy refused in the past.
		Chandru parts ways with his father because of his excessive insistence on honesty and righteousness, also he considers these values to be dead and worthless.
		Public support surges for the Indian as he exposes so many corrupt people.
		Senapathy does not do his son any favours either.
		Chandru had earlier taken a bribe and given a safety certificate to a bus with faulty brakes, which eventually killed forty school children it was carrying and thus Chandru is held responsible.
		Senapathy is bent on giving Chandru the same punishment as he gives others,e, death.
		Towards the end, a chase culminates at airport, where Senapathy kills Chandru and apparently dies in an explosion.
		Krishnaswamy discovers that Senapathi escaped moments before the jeep is exploded killing his son in the explosion, while investigating the television footage at airport.

	Much as in Welcome to the Rileys, where: 
		Ever since the death of their teenage daughter Emily, Doug (James Gandolfini) and Lois (Melissa Leo) Riley have been drifting apart.
		Because of her grief, Lois has become a cold and distant agoraphobic.
		Doug begins an affair with Vivian, a younger local waitress.
		However, Lois manages to maintain her appearance and the presentation of her home despite never leaving and inviting no guests aside from her sister, Harriet.
		She has even already had headstones put next to their daughter's for them both and made funeral plans.
		One morning, Doug is informed that Vivian has died, and he travels to New Orleans on a business trip to clear his head.
		Instead, however, he ends up in a strip club where he meets 16-year-old stripper, Mallory (Kristen Stewart).
		He politely turns down her offer for a private dance and refuses any sexual contact, but instead accompanies her home and makes an unusual proposition: if Mallory will allow him to stay in her run-down house long enough to straighten himself out, he will pay her $100 a day for her trouble.
		For Mallory, who isn't used to getting money for doing nothing, it seems like a great deal.
		She accepts and Doug phones home to tell Lois he won't be coming home for a while.
		She tells him that she knew about his affair with Vivian but before the conversation can go any further, she hangs up.
		As time passes, Doug and Mallory settle into an unconventional kind of domesticity, and he becomes more of a father figure for her than anything else including teaching her how to make a bed properly and taking care of her money.
		Meanwhile, back home, Lois realizes that she'll have to act fast in order to save her marriage, even if that means venturing outside for the first time in nearly a decade.
		After a couple of attempts, Lois manages to start up her car and get on the freeway heading south.
		One night, Doug gets a call from Mallory who is in trouble after being robbed of the money she carries around by a client.
		He goes to pick her up and after arguing about how stupid she's being, he makes her realise that she needs to make some changes before things get worse.
		The following morning, Lois arrives in town and calls Doug to let him know, who is stunned that she not only left the house but drove all the way instead of flying.
		He immediately goes to meet her and they embrace one another for the first time in years.
		On the drive back, he tells her about Mallory (whose real name is Alison) and what she does for a living, which Lois instantly disapproves of.
		She is shocked to learn how young and foul-mouthed Mallory is.
		However, like Doug, Lois quickly warms to her due to her striking similarities to Emily.
		Before long, Lois has also moved in to Mallory's home and the three start to form an unconventional family.
		Lois helps her out with female problems and takes her shopping to buy suitable underwear, making her feel like a mother again, which she enjoys dearly.
		But later on when Lois attempts to steer Mallory from the path of self-destruction, the young girl flees.
		Mallory is then later arrested an altercation with a client, and Doug and Lois rush to be by her side, but shortly after they bail her out, she runs again.
		In that moment, Doug and Lois realize they cannot use Mallory as a substitute for their daughter and return home to Indianapolis.
		A few days later, Doug receives a phone call from Mallory in Houston.
		She looks cleaned up and healthier, and announces her plans about moving to Las Vegas, just before boarding the bus.
		Doug tells her that he and Lois will always be there for her.

		The story is a to-do list and a how-to-do list containing one sentence of a 650 word dialogue.
		It features what the girl hears from her mother.
		The story is mostly told in the second person.
		The girl hears her mother's instructions and the behavior her mother is trying to instill in herYou can see that the mother is trying to give the girl some sort of advice and prescribing the way she should go about her life and daily tasks.
		We can infer that her mother probably got this language from someone in her past and it was most likely the way her mother spoke to her when she was a young girl, so that's all she's ever known.
		During the story, her mother's voice sounds somewhat condescending and critical when speaking, suggesting that the girl is likely to become a "slut".
		For example, in the short story, the mother states, "on Sundays try to walk like a lady and not like the slut you are so bent on becoming".
		Throughout the piece we can see that the mother is trying to pass down certain beliefs from her culture to her daughter that the mother wants her to inhabit.
		The mother constantly reminds her daughter of how to become the "perfect" woman in order to fit into the society that they live in.
		Also, the chores and behaviors that the mother makes the daughter inhabit are directly related to how women's duties should relate to a man's.
		Like most of Kincaid's piece of writing, "Girl" is based on her own relationship between her and her mother while growing up.

	Much as in Hinds' Feet on High Places, where: 
		It is the story of a young woman named Much Afraid, and her journey away from her Fearing family and into the High Places of the Shepherd, guided by her two companions Sorrow and Suffering.
		It is an allegory of a Christian devotional life from salvation through maturity.
		It aims to show how a Christian is transformed from unbeliever to immature believer to mature believer, who walks daily with God as easily on the High Places of Joy in the spirit as in the daily life of mundane and often humiliating tasks that may cause Christians to lose perspective.
		The book takes its title from Habakkuk 3:19, "The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places".
		The story begins in the Valley of Humiliation with Much Afraid, being beset by the unwanted advances of her cousin, Craven Fear, who wishes to marry her.
		Much Afraid is ugly from all outward appearances, walking on club feet, sporting gnarled, deformed hands, and speaking from a crooked mouth that seems to have been made so by a stroke or the like.
		The Good Shepherd is tender and gentle with Much Afraid, especially in the beginning.
		However, His many sudden departures may strike the reader as bizarre, given the human penchant to expect kindly souls to never do anything that may be interpreted as rude or as hurtful in any way.
		Yet, though the Shepherd leaves in a moment, He returns the same way at the first furtive cry of the forlorn little protagonist.
		"Come, Shepherd, for I am much afraid.
		"  When Much Afraid intimates that she would love to be able to dance upon the high places as do the sure-footed deer, the Shepherd commends her for this desire.
		In order to accomplish this, he offers to "plant the seed of love" into her heart.
		At first sight of the long, black Hawthorne-looking seed, she shrieks in fear.
		Soon, she relents, and after the initial intense pain, she senses that something is indeed different in her, though she still looks the same, for now.
		Just when the reader thinks that Much Afraid is about to reach the High Places, the path turns downward towards a seemingly endless desert.
		There is incident with an extremely high cliff that must be ascended by a steep, slippery and very narrow zig-zagging track, with the help of her two companions, Sorrow and Suffering.
		Then days are spent in a forest that is shrouded in a thick cloud of fog.
		During this time Much Afraid is sequestered with her two friends in a log cabin.
		The climax is an unexpected twist that comes as Much Afraid despairs of ever reaching the High Places.

		None of the boys in the South Park Cows, the town's Little League Baseball team, enjoy the sport at all.
		They find baseball boring, playing only because of their parents' enthusiasm for the sport.
		When they win their final game, they are at first overjoyed to have the rest of the summer free until they discover with horror that since they placed first in their division, they will have to continue playing in the post-season playoffs.
		During a 'celebration' meal, the team discusses plans to lose on purpose while making it look like they are trying.
		However, South Park realizes that the other teams also want out and have actually trained to lose games.
		The South Park Cows end up winning again and again against opponents whose efforts at throwing games are more successful, and eventually, they get to the state championship game.
		To their horror, they realize that if they win that game, their season will start over on the national circuit, meaning they will have to play baseball all summer.
		Meanwhile, Stan's father Randy has taken up the hobby of being a "trash-talking dad", being generally obnoxious at every game so as to get into fights with other, equally obnoxious fathers.
		While training to be the best fighter he can be, Randy becomes terrified when he meets the Denver Little League team's "Bat Dad", who wears a purple Batman cowl and cape, is much bigger than him, and behaves even more obnoxiously.
		He decides not to attend the game in fear that he isn't good enough.
		Cartman tells the team that they need someone who "totally sucks ass" to join their team.
		Kyle says he knows just the person: his nerdy cousin Kyle Schwartz, who is terrible at all sports.
		Stan and the others play their game against Denver, who, like the other opponents, do not want to win either.
		Even drafting Kyle's cousin fails, as the other team is the best yet at intentionally losing.
		Just as it seems the South Park team is sure to win, Randy shows up and begins a huge fight with Bat Dad that spills onto the field.
		Randy continuing to fight as the boys cheer him on causes officials to disqualify South Park and the team celebrates.

		All is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by, dressed in a farmer's-type outfit with a big straw hat, and carrying a satchel inscribed "Anthony Flea" also known as Flea.
		Pulling out his telescope and spotting the dog, he whistles and screams in excitement before beginning to sing "Food Around the Corner", which become a recurring theme throughout the cartoon.
		The flea then begins to find a suitable portion of the dog for him to eat or work on, which in turn causes the dog to scratch and bite the flea.
		Elmer soon notices this and threatens to give the dog a bath if he witnesses him scratching again, which the dog promises not to do.
		The flea continues searching for meat and uses pickaxes, jackhammers and even explosives while the dog tries to withstand the suffering pain, but finally yelps and runs around.
		Elmer then advances on the dog, grasps him, and carries him to the bathroom.
		However, the flea manages to get on Elmer, causing him to scratch, and the dog proceeds to carry Elmer and give him a bath.
		He promptly slips on a soap bar on the floor and lands in the kitchen sink.

		They arrive in Santa Fe several months after leaving st Louis and Garnet is reunited with Florinda, who was traveling "in sin" with a deacon from st Louis.
		She and Garnet rekindle their friendship.
		Shortly after their arrival in Santa Fe, the traders from California arrive in the city, too.

		Along with the original Black Hole army's commanding officers (COs), four new COs were recruited, under the command of Sturm.
		Sturm orders each Black Hole CO to invade and capture each of the four continents controlled by the four other armies from the original game: Orange Star was to be taken by Flak, Blue Moon by Lash, Yellow Comet by Adder, and Green Earth by Hawke.
		Lash also invented several new war weapons like the Black Cannon and the Mini Cannons that were to be put to use in this invasion.
		The four allied armies must now work together to drive Black Hole out of their world once and for all.
		Once the Black Hole troops are driven from the Allied Nations' continents, their COs convene in Black Hole territory, near Black Hole's base of operations.
		Here they fight Sturm, the mastermind behind the invasion.
		The final battle takes place in front of the Death Ray, a powerful new weapon guarding the entrance to a missile, which, if not subdued in time, would destroy half of Wars World.
		The Death Ray is eventually destroyed by the COs of the Allied Nations, who manage to disarm the missile and corner Sturm.
		In an act of desperation, Sturm attempts to blow up the base and inflict damage on Wars World by self-destructing the missile.
		Andy attempts to stop Sturm to no avail.
		However, in a surprising turn of events, Hawke, second in command to Sturm, betrays his leader by killing him with Black Storm before the self-destruct is triggered.
		Hawke takes over as leader of Black Hole, and along with Flak, Lash, and Adder, leaves Macro Land with the few troops he has left.

	Much as in Forbidden World, where: 
		In the distant future, at a genetic research station located on the remote desert planet of Xarbia, a research team has created an experimental lifeform they have designated "Subject 20".
		This lifeform was built out of the synthetic DNA strain, "Proto B", and was intended to stave off a galaxy-wide food crisis.
		However, Subject 20 mutates rapidly and uncontrollably and kills all of the laboratory subject animals before cocooning itself within an examination booth.
		After Subject 20 hatches from its cocoon, it begins killing the personnel at the station, starting with the lab tech charged with cleansing the subject lab of the dead animal test subjects.
		Professional troubleshooter Mike Colby, accompanied by his robot assistant SAM-104, is called in to investigate the problem.
		After Colby settles in, his decision to terminate Subject 20 to prevent further deaths is met with research-minded secrecy and resistance.
		The staff of the station includes the head of research, Gordon Hauser, his assistant Barbara Glaser, lab assistant Tracy Baxter, the station head of security and Cal Timbergen, the chief of bacteriology.
		As Subject 20 continues to kill most of the station crew, the reason for the deception is revealed.
		Subject 20's genetic design incorporates human DNA, and its method of killing is to inject its prey with the Proto B DNA strain which then proceeds to remove all genetic differences within specific cells.
		The result is that the victim's living body slowly erodes into gelatinous pile of pure protein which Subject 20 consumes for sustenance.
		After its final mutation, where the creature evolves into a huge insect-like being with a large mouth full of sharp teeth, the creature is slain when it eats Cal's cancer-ridden liver, its body genetically self-destructing from within.
		Mike and Tracy are the only survivors.

		Singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) is out of work and looking for a job.
		After pawning his guitar, he meets former rodeo sharpshooter Angie Burke (Vera Marshe), who works for wealthy ranch owner Estrellita Estrada (Elena Verdugo).
		Angie suggests that Gene ride across the border to El Sombrero Grande, Estrellita's ranch.
		Gene learns that the ranch is managed by James Garland (Stephen Dunne), an acquaintance from their days with Monahan's Wild West Show.
		Gene heads south into Mexico.
		As Gene approaches the ranch, he comes across a fight between Garland and the rancheros, who rent part of the land.
		Garland is in the process of forcing them off the property.
		Gene stops Garland from shooting the unarmed men.
		Garland offers Gene the job of ranch foreman and tells him that he plans to marry Estrellita.
		On the way back to the ranch, Gene offers a ride to Don Luis Alvarado (William Edmunds), Estrellita's godfather.
		Don Luis has been hired to replace Felipe Gonzales (Martin Garralaga), who has worked on the ranch all his life.
		Gene does not want to displace Felipe, but he decides to accept the job in order to help the rancheros, who are led by Juan Vazcaro.
		Gene hires Felipe as his translator.
		Gene travels back to the United States planning to bring Estrellita back to her ranch in Mexico.
		Angie, who has been accompanying Estrellita in America, opposes Gene's plan, but Gene and Don Luis are able to kidnap Estrellita and drive her back to El Sombrero Grande.
		Meanwhile, Garland plots to sell the ranch to Ben McBride (Gene Roth).
		McBride pressures Garland to get rid of the rancheros before they can sell their cattle and pay their back rent.
		When gene learns of the plot, he secretly organizes a cattle drive with the rancheros.
		As Gene and Juan ride to a meeting of the rancheros, they are shot at by one of Garland's men.
		Gene and Juan capture him and then learn that the other rancheros are under attack.
		Although the rancheros are able to fight off Garland's men, a young boy named Tico accidentally reveals to Garland the plans for Gene's cattle drive.
		Meanwhile, Gene encourages Estrellita to take an interest in her ranch, but she is still eager to return to the United States.
		After the rancheros leave on the cattle drive, Garland and McBride ambush them at a mountain pass.
		During the gunfight, the young boy Tico is killed.
		The rancheros bring the boy's body back to the ranch.
		Garland professes his innocence, but Estrellita now knows his real intentions and orders him to leave the country.

		The film shows us their daily life in Lanzarote and their trips around the globe, and is a surprising portrayal of an author throughout the creative process of a couple decided to change the world, or at least to make it a better place.
		The film shows us an hidden Saramago, unravels any preconceived ideas we may have about the man and proves that genius and simplicity are indeed compatible.

	Much as in Serglige Con Culainn, where: 
		The Ulster hero C  Chulainn is with other men in Muirtheimne, hunting birds by the water.
		A number of the men kill two birds for their wives, so the women may wear feathers on each shoulder of their gowns.
		When all the women but Emer have birds, C  Chulainn becomes determined to kill the largest, most beautiful birds for her.
		The only birds still in the sky are indeed the largest and most exotic-looking, but the two seabirds are linked by a golden chain and sing a magical sleeping song.
		Emer recognizes that this means they are from the Otherworld and tells C  Chulainn not to kill them.
		He attempts to do so anyway, but only manages to strike one of the birds on the feathers of her wing, damaging her wing, but not inflicting a mortal wound.
		C  Chulainn falls ill, and lies unconscious and feverish next to a standing stone.
		In his fevered state he sees two women approaching.
		They are Fand and L  Ban, whom he assaulted while they were in bird form.
		They have horsewhips and beat him almost to death.
		He lies ill in bed for nearly a year, until L  Ban returns, asking him to come to Mag Mell and help Fand defeat her enemies in a battle there.
		In exchange for his military aid, Fand will agree to heal him of his illness.
		C  Chulainn refuses, but his charioteer, L eg, agrees to go.
		At this point, the story is interrupted by C  Chulainn suddenly giving a long series of advice to his foster-son Lugaid R oderg, the newly chosen king of Tara.
		This material is part of the genre of tecosca ('precepts, instructions') and, in Dillon's estimation, 'can hardly belong to the story in its original form'.
		However, C  Chulainn's uncharacteristic wisdom here can be understood as a beneficial side-effect of his magically inflicted illness.
		On his return, L eg, with the help of Emer (who berates her husband for choosing his pride over his health) manages to convince C  Chulainn to accompany him to Fand's lands.
		In Mag Mell he joins the battle, and helps defeat Fand and L  Ban's enemies.
		Fand agrees to sleep with him, but this is discovered by Emer, who confronts Fand, accompanied by a troop of women armed with knives.
		After much discussion both women recognize the other's unselfish love, and request that C  Chulainn take the other.
		Fand decides that since she already has a husband, Manann n mac Lir, Emer should stay with C  Chulainn so she will not be left alone.
		C  Chulainn and Fand are both heartbroken, however.
		Fand asks Manann n to shake his cloak of mist between her and C  Chulainn, ensuring that they will never meet again.
		The druids give C chulainn and Emer a potion of forgetfulness, and they forget the entire affair.
		The text closes with a statement generally attributed to scribe who altered the manuscript text (sometimes omitted from translations), that 'that is the disastrous vision shown to C  Chulainn by the fairies.
		For the diabolical power was great before the faith, and it was so great that devils used to fight with men in bodily form, and used to show delights and mysteries to them, as though they really existed.
		So they were believed to be; and ignorant men used to call those visions s de and  es s de'.

		After taking money from his father's wallet, he walks, in his pajamas, to the store to buy some.
		While his brother is gone shopping, Tom (Evan Bird) wakes up to find he has wet his bed.
		He tosses his soiled pajamas and sheets downstairs into the moving company's trash can.
		Back upstairs, he sees Denny eating Rosie's cereal and threatens to tell their parents.
		Denny replies that their parents don t care what the boys do.
		Later, Terry (Jamie Anne Allman) hears the boys mention that there is no food in the house and offers to go to the store.
		Mitch (Michelle Forbes) says that she will buy the groceries.
		Downstairs, Belko tells Stan that their moving jobs are being canceled because of Rosie s death and offers to find out whom at the high school is being investigated.
		Stan originally declines the offer, but, later, grief causes him to accept.
		At the high school, Sarah and Holder ask Bennet if he ever drove one of Richmond s campaign cars.
		He tells them that he has not.
		He adds that he returned home after the Halloween dance.
		His wife cannot confirm this, because the floors in their house were being refinished, so she stayed with her sister to avoid the fumes.
		As for the flooring company, they canceled at the last minute and also cannot confirm his alibi.
		Sarah asks about his letters to Rosie.
		Bennet replies that they were an  intellectual discourse.
		  To prove Rosie s intelligence, he gives the detectives a Super 8 mm film project that she had done.
		At the police station, Sarah and Holder view Rosie's film, which shows images of butterflies and Rosie riding a bicycle.
		Sarah says that someone else helped make the film and wonders if one shot might contain a reflected face.
		Outside the station, Sarah spies Holder receiving an envelope from a man in a car.
		In his office, she sees Holder counting what he says are blackjack winnings.
		He tells her that the flooring company says that Bennet canceled the job, which contradicts Bennet s previous statement.
		At his apartment, Gwen (Kristin Lehman) tells Darren that the Larsen death harms the campaign and asks him to request that the parents appear in a commercial.
		Later, at a boathouse, he meets Jamie (Eric Ladin), who informs him of an upcoming meeting with Mayor Adams and again argues that Gwen is the campaign's leak.
		Richmond does not think so.
		Later, at the supermarket, he approaches Mitch and tells her of his own grief following his wife's death.
		He tries to comfort her then leaves.
		In his car, he tells Gwen that Mitch was not in the store.
		Jamie meets with Mayor Adams (Tom Butler) and his campaign director, Benjamin Abani (Colin Lawrence), at a private club.
		He admits to frustration with Richmond.
		Adams then mentions discovering that Councilwoman Yitanes had tried to plant someone in his own campaign.
		Later, Jamie and Richmond again secretly meet, where Jamie tells him that Yitanes is the leak and reminds him that Gwen previously worked for the councilwoman.
		At the high school, Holder wonders if a tryst gone wrong led Bennet to kill Rosie.
		Sarah muses that perhaps Bennet canceled the flooring appointment so he could clean the apartment before his wife returned.
		The detectives interview Principal Meyers, who reveals that Bennet married a former student.
		Sarah and Holder visit Bennet's pregnant wife, Amber (Ashley Johnson).
		She also talks of letters Bennet wrote to her while she was in high school, encouraging her to pursue her dreams.
		Amber says that, on Friday night, she drove the couple's car to her sister's house at Bennet's request.
		Sarah asks to use the bathroom, but, instead, examines a room containing plastic sheeting and chemicals, including ammonium hydroxide.
		Holder continues chatting with Amber.
		She tells him that Bennet called her at ten o'clock on Friday night from his cell phone, not the apartment's phone.
		Back at the station, Holder wants to arrest Bennet, but Sarah says they must first place Rosie in his apartment.
		Sarah then requests that Rosie's body be tested for ammonium hydroxide.
		Richmond receives an envelope at his office followed by a phone call from Jamie.
		Minutes later, security guards remove communications aide Nathan Patrick (Peter Benson).
		That evening, Richmond and Gwen accuse Councilwoman Yitanes of planting Nathan to leak campaign information, in order to manipulate Richmond.
		He threatens to have her arrested for the felony if she withdraws her endorsement.
		As she leaves, she mentions to Gwen that he also investigated her e-mails.
		A lab technician (David Bloom) tells Sarah that Rosie tested clean for drugs and alcohol but positive for ammonium hydroxide, which could explain the lack of evidence under her nails and the inconclusive tests for sexual assault.
		Sarah remarks that the killer sounds like a professional and later analyzes still pictures captured from Rosie s film.
		Elsewhere, Holder stands outside a house, watching a woman and two children inside, before placing an envelope in the home's mailbox.

	Much as in The Incident (2011 film), where: 
		During 1989 in Washington, George (Rupert Evans), Max (Kenny Doughty) and Ricky (Joseph Kennedy) are in a band, but it is clear that the group is starting to fall apart.
		Ricky is unreliable, Max is immature and George is becoming distant as he builds a relationship with his girlfriend Lynn (Anna Skellern).
		In order to make ends meet, the three also work in the cafeteria of an asylum for the criminally insane along with William (Marcus Garvey).
		George is the head chef and puts effort into preparing high quality food and being courteous to the inmates.
		The inmates are generally docile due to the pills they take, but one inmate in particular named Harry Green (Richard Brake) creeps George out.
		One morning after a late-night rock show, an exhausted George has to come in early to work in a torrential downpour.
		Many bad omens occur, with the chicken meat still attached to the heads, George cutting himself, and later, he loses his temper at both his bandmates and Harry, who stares menacingly at him.
		George also thinks that he sees Harry convince a fellow inmate to spit out his pills.
		Max tells George to take a nap while he prepares dinner.
		A few hours later, however, an explosion is heard and Max wakes George up to tell him that the power has gone out in the building.
		Because the exterior doors are electronically locked, everyone is now trapped inside the building.
		Many of the inmates have already been brought into the dining room for dinner service and the head guard enlists George and William to help escort them back to their cells.
		Unknown to those in the kitchen, several other inmates have seized the opportunity to overtake and kill the prison guards and nurses on the other side of the building.
		George and William succeed in getting the inmates to their cells, but they see that the inmates are growing restless and the locks on all the doors are not working.
		When they return to the kitchen, they find the head guard has disappeared and Ricky and Max have barricaded themselves in the freezer.
		Suddenly, several inmates walk into the dining area and begin trying to break into the kitchen.
		Max, William, and George manage to sneak out of the kitchen after the inmates break in, but Ricky refuses to come with them and remains barricaded in the freezer.
		George sees Harry smiling at all of the mayhem, appearing to be the ringleader of the riots.

		They eventually make their way to the head guard's office and use the landline phone to call the police, but are told that the police will be unable to respond for at least an hour.
		Eventually, the prisoners capture Ricky and fatally impale him in front of George, Max, and William.
		At Harry's urging, the inmates storm the head guard office, although the cooks manage to kill all of the ones who attack however, Max's nose is bitten off in the struggle.
		The three flee back to the kitchen, but eventually George is knocked out and Max is captured.
		When George awakens, he is naked and tied to a table.
		George is forced to watch as inmates burn Max alive on the stove top.
		One inmate also begins mutilating George, though eventually George convinces him to leave him alone.
		George is finally confronted by Harry, who begins to gleefully eat his own fingers.
		George screams at Harry to end the madness to no avail.
		George hears police sirens and soon, William leads the police into the kitchen, but Harry has disappeared.
		As the medics begin wheeling George out of the asylum, he looks over to see the corpse of Harry, with all his fingers intact, apparently having been killed at the very beginning of the riot.
		Apparently, George has hallucinated Harry's presence throughout the night.
		The film jumps ahead to focus on George in a bed while Lynn cries at his side.

		She is a godly, well-off widow.
		Yeon-hee remains hopeful in her faith that her daughter Ye-eun will be able to get a heart transplant surgery.
		But Yeon-hee has hired black-market organ dealers to search a healthy heart for her daughter.
		One donor is a live illegal immigrant, and Yeon-hee cannot bring herself to take his life in exchange for sending money to his family abroad.
		Time after time, the donors slip through her hands.
		Tired of waiting, Yeon-hee takes matters into her own hands, and betrays her conscience.
		She pays an exorbitant amount of money to arrange a transplant: the donor is a patient in a persistent vegetative state, and thus unable to consent.
		Yeon-hee rationalizes to her doctor friend that the vegetative patient is an answered prayer and pleads him to perform the transplant.
		Out of her guilt, Yeon-hee monologues to the patient, and cries that she would even go to hell for the illegal surgery, if it could save her little Ye-eun.
		When the time nears for her daughter's heart transplant surgery, Lee Hwi-do (Park Hae-il), the son of the woman in the vegetative state, suddenly appears to stop the transplant.
		In the past, Hwi-do was a bad son often leeching money off of his mother.
		He parted ways with his mother, but when he learns of the current situation he tries to protect his mother.
		With only a single heart, Yeon-hee and Hwi-do both are both desperate to save the one they love.
		Just when Yeon-hee is about to carry the patient in an ambulance, Hwi-do shows up and gets into the ambulance with them.
		During the ride, he confiscates the transplant contracts from Yeon-hee (signed by Kang, who dated Hwi-do's mother for money), and takes over the driver's seat.
		Yeon-hee runs after the ambulance, but it is gone.
		Hwi-do brings his mother to a hospital, but Yeon-hee tracks down the hospital.
		Hwi-do and his girlfriend visit Ye-eun's hospital room to take Ye-eun captive.
		Hwi-do decides that he won't abduct Ye-eun, until Yeon-hee calls him that she is sorry for taking his mother.
		He then kidnaps Ye-eun, of which Yeon-hee's doctor friend notifies Yeon-hee about.
		Ye-eun records a conversation on her teddy bear while telling Hwi-do that her mother is not a bad person.

	Much as in Star Island (novel), where: 
		Ann DeLusia, the "stunt double" for habitually intoxicated and drug-addicted pop star "Cherry Pye", is mistakenly kidnapped by an obsessed paparazzo.
		Now, the star's entourage must find a way to rescue Ann, and do it without revealing her identity to the star herself, or the world at large.
		The novel also features the re-appearance of Hiaasen's recurring character, ex-Florida governor Clinton "Skink" Tyree.
		Paparazzo "Bang" Abbott is lying in wait outside a posh South Beach hotel, on a tip that pop star "Cherry Pye" has overdosed again.
		However, when the paramedics bring a woman down to the ambulance, he sees that she is a body double.
		Meanwhile, the real Cherry is being driven to the nearest hospital in a private limousine by her entourage.
		The body double is Ann DeLusia, an actress hired by Cherry's family to make brief public appearances when Cherry is too inebriated to do so.
		Cherry's mother/manager, Janet Bunterman, tells Ann to take a few days off, while Cherry is packed off, yet again, to "dietary camp" (ie, drug rehab).
		Infuriated at having been fooled by a body double, Abbott becomes even more obsessed with getting photos of Cherry under sordid circumstances.
		In Los Angeles, Cherry jumps over the wall of the rehab center and hitches a ride to the airport from a nearby motorist, who happens to be Abbott staking out the clinic.
		Pleased by his transparent flattery, Cherry takes him along when she charters a private jet to Florida.
		Aboard the plane, Abbott is astonished when she decides to have an onboard quickie with him.
		His astonishment turns to outrage when Cherry drives away in a limousine and strands him at the airport, taking his camera bag and BlackBerry with her.
		Ann decides to spend her few days off touring the Florida Keys, but while driving through Key Largo, she swerves to avoid a man scooping a roadkill off the highway, and her car goes off a bridge.
		When she wakes up, the man, "Skink" has rescued her.
		With apologies, Skink brings her along on a brief mission to kidnap and intimidate real estate developer Jackie Sebago.
		Afterwards, Skink has a friend give her a ride to the nearest hospital, and gives her the number for his seldom-used cell phone, to call in case she ever needs help.
		Over Janet's protests, Cherry's record promoter, Maury Lykes, assigns a man nicknamed "Chemo" to replace Cherry's recently fired bodyguard.
		As revenge for her theft of his cameras and smartphone, Bang Abbott kidnaps Cherry outside her hotel at gunpoint, only to realize that the woman he has snatched is Ann.
		He demands, in exchange for Ann's safe return, that Cherry be made available to him for a private photo shoot.
		Ann is furious to hear that the Buntermans have not even reported her missing (since their paramount concern is that Ann's role remain a secret from the media, and from Cherry herself).
		She hurriedly uses her cell phone to call the only number she has: Skink's.
		When the Buntermans refuse to agree to Abbott's demand, he dresses Ann up in costume and shoots pictures of her with a discarded syringe, making it look as if "Cherry" is a drug addict.
		His threat to release those pictures to the media is taken much more seriously by the Buntermans than his threat against Ann's life.
		In fact, since Cherry's career is dangerously close to ending already (because of her reckless behavior and lack of talent), her father, Ned, suggests using the kidnapping as a publicity stunt to boost interest in Cherry's upcoming concert tour and comeback album.
		The photo shoot and hostage exchange takes place on Star Island, in the rented home of Cherry's actor boyfriend.
		Cherry is duped into thinking that she is posing for the cover of Vanity Fair, while Ann confronts her employers over their indifference to her safety.
		At that moment, Skink tracks her down, and Ann prefers to leave with him rather than the Buntermans.
		After the photo shoot, Chemo confiscates the digital memory cards from Abbott's cameras.
		Maury had ordered him to kill Abbott, but Abbott convinces him that once Cherry is dead, they can make a fortune publishing them, so Chemo decides to let Abbott live and hang on to the photos.
		The Buntermans meet with Ann and Skink and offer her $50,000 in hush money.
		Ann declines, settling instead for plane fare back to California and the price of a Zegna suit she bought for Skink.
		She also informs them that she's quitting her role as Cherry's double, and warns them never to contact her again.
		Maury flirts with the idea of paying Chemo to kill her, but Chemo refuses and warns Maury not to send anyone else after her (after less than a week spent with Cherry and her parents, Chemo is now firmly on Ann's side).
		In private, the Buntermans admit to Cherry that the Vanity Fair photo shoot was a ruse, but she is pleased to hear that she will be the star of a media blitz surrounding her fictional kidnapping.
		Cherry is upset to be told that, to sell the story, she will need to be secluded for a few days, ostensibly "recovering" from her ordeal, and privately vows to make the most of the remaining night.
		With Skink's assistance, Ann has come up with her own plan, partly as a snub to the Buntermans, and partly to save Cherry from her self-destructive addictions (since no one else, least of all her own parents, is interested in doing so).
		With a tip-off from one of Abbott's South Beach informants, Ann makes a conspicuous appearance at an exclusive nightclub, using Cherry's name.
		A short time later, Cherry escapes from her parents' guard at the hotel and goes to the club with her actor boyfriend.
		At the club, Ann approaches Cherry and tells her the truth about her role as Cherry's "stunt double".
		Cherry takes the revelation badly, launching herself at Ann in an inebriated rage, all of which is witnessed by the clubgoers, before Chemo arrives to carry her out.
		As he is doing so, Cherry vomits, inadvertently ruining the memory cards in his pocket containing the Star Island photos.
		Cherry's "meltdown" is captured in graphic detail by the horde of paparazzi outside the club, instantly sabotaging her entourage's chances of selling the bogus kidnapping story.
		Ann and Skink slip away in the chaos.
		Abbott, however, does not get a photo of Cherry.
		Like the other paparazzi, he is lying in wait outside the club, but he is shot through the buttocks by a thug hired by one of his disgruntled tipsters.
		The tipster sent the information to Abbott's BlackBerry while Cherry had possession of it, and Abbott was unaware that the man was expecting his usual fee.
		In a touch of poetic justice, Abbott finds himself on the receiving end of his profession's notorious indifference to pain and suffering: as he lies in agony on the sidewalk, none of his fellow "shooters" are inclined to give him aid, but just keep snapping pictures of him as he is lifted into an ambulance.

	Much as in Darwin's Radio, where: 
		In the novel, a new form of endogenous retrovirus has emerged, SHEVA.
		It controls human evolution by rapidly evolving the next generation while in the womb, leading to speciation.
		The novel follows several characters as the "plague" is discovered as well as the panicked reaction of the public and theS.
		government to the disease.
		Built into the human genome are non-coding sequences of DNA called introns.
		In Darwin's Radio, certain portions of these "non-sense" sequences, remnants of prehistoric retroviruses, have been activated and are translating numerous LPCs (large protein complexes).
		The activation of SHEVA and its consequential sudden speciation was postulated to be either controlled by a complex genetic network that perceives a need for modification or a human adaptive response to overcrowding.
		The disease, or rather, gene activation, is passed on laterally from male to female as per an STD.
		If impregnated, a woman in her first trimester who has contracted SHEVA will miscarry a deformed female fetus made of little more than two ovaries.
		This "first stage fetus" leaves behind a fertilized egg with fifty-two chromosomes rather than the typical forty-six characteristic of Homo sapiens sapiens.
		During the third trimester of the second stage pregnancy, both parents go into a pre-speciation puberty to prepare them for the needs of their novel child.
		Facial pigmentation changes underneath the old skin which begins sloughing off like a mask.
		Vocal organs and olfactory glands alter and sensitize respectively, to adapt for a new form of communication.
		For over a year after the first SHEVA outbreak in the United States, no second stage fetus was recorded to have been born alive.
		The new human species was highly sensitive to all varieties of herpes and could not be viably born to a mother who had ever been infected with any of the virus' many forms, including Epstein-Barr and the chickenpox   thus eliminating 95% of the female population.
		Anesthetics and pitocin administered during childbirth were also lethal.
		So while many women would contract activated SHEVA, few would be able to successfully give birth, making the transition from Homo sapiens sapiens to the new human species very gradual.
		The international response to the threat of SHEVA was to form a special task force that would work alongside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to find a vaccine.
		Because the "disease", called "Herod's Flu", was already in the genome of every person on Earth, the only two options were to either inhibit the activation of the SHEVA gene by discovering the signal it used or to abort the second stage fetus.
		Due to the rapid mutation rate of the missing-link signal molecule, preventing the activation of the gene was infeasible.
		The second option, abortion, was already a controversial issue and the proposal of handing out free RU 486 was met with social upheaval, adding to the already chaotic social scene.
		The general public believed that the government was either not placing due importance on the death of countless fetuses, or already had a cure and refused to release it.
		In response, government research facilities were forced to test prospective treatments prematurely and could not pursue explanations for SHEVA outside of the "disease" category because of the potential reactions from the masses.
		It was not until viable second stage fetuses were born that the idea of SHEVA being a part of evolution rather than a disease began to grow from a few isolated sources.

	Much as in Cyborg Cop II, where: 
		Crime boss Jesse Starkraven leads his gang in an attack on a drug den not cooperating with Starkraven's demands; the assault quickly turns into a hostage situation when police arrive.
		Renegade DEA agent Jack Ryan arrives and attempts to negotiate with Starkraven, however this fails when Starkraven recognizes Ryan as the officer who killed his brother Harlan during a crime some time prior.
		Starkraven kills several hostages including Ryan's partner before he is finally captured.
		Subsequently, Starkraven is convinced of killing a cop and sentenced to death.
		While awaiting his sentence on death row, Starkraven is kidnapped by government agents under the guise of a prison transfer.
		He is taken into the custody of the "Anti-Terrorism Group" and converted into a cyborg alongside several other test subjects.
		Now dubbed "Spartacus" by the scientists, he is meant to lead the army of cyborg soldiers.
		Meanwhile, Ryan learns of Starkraven's apparent escape and begins conducting an investigation to find him against the orders of his boss, Captain Salerno.
		He collaborates with former sheriff Sam Pickens, who is still well respected in the community even after being removed from office for looking too far into the ATG's activity.
		During a party to celebrate the success of the project, head scientist dr Owns takes a woman into the room where Spartacus and the other cyborgs are awaiting activation.
		While they have a romantic encounter, Spartacus suddenly awakens and attacks them, killing the woman while taking Owns hostage.
		Spartacus seizes and destroys all but one control bracelet, which he keeps for himself to give himself control over the other cyborgs.
		He has the other cyborgs kill everyone at the party by burning down the building before leaving in a truck with Owns held hostage for a second facility, where more cyborgs are being created.
		ATG project leader Liz McDowell arrives the next day to review the incident and attempts to track down Spartacus quietly.
		However, Ryan's investigation brings him to her attention.
		She sends agents to follow him, but he swiftly dispatches them.
		Later, he breaks into an ATG office to gather information.
		He is detected by dogs and confronted by security guards, but escapes after discovering proof that Starkraven was taken by the ATG for conversion into a cyborg.
		Meanwhile, Spartacus and some of the other cyborgs travel to a gas station to steal fuel for their recharging generators.
		Ryan arrives and saves a woman and young boy from them, but is defeated by Spartacus and nearly killed, but he survives when authorities arrive and critically damage Spartacus, forcing the cyborgs to retreat.

		He subsequently escapes from her men and travels to Pickens' home in order to prepare for an assault on Spartacus's headquarters.

 DNA test ordered from a court
	Much as in The Invasion (Doctor Who), where: 
		The TARDIS evades a missile fired by a spaceship on the Moon, landing the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe in late twentieth-century England.
		The visual stabiliser is damaged and renders the TARDIS invisible, so they try to find Professor Edward Travers (of The Abominable Snowmen and The Web of Fear) to seek his assistance.
		They hitch a lift to London, and the lorry driver talks of International Electromatics, the world's largest electronics manufacturer.
		The Doctor discovers that Professor Travers has left for America with his daughter, leaving his London home in the care of Isobel Watkins and her scientist uncle, Professor Watkins, who has mysteriously disappeared while working for the same company, International Electromatics.
		The Doctor and Jamie go to IE's head office in London, to investigate.
		When the electronic receptionist refuses them entry, they seek out a back entrance, but are arrested and taken before IE's Managing Director, the sinister Tobias Vaughn, who gives them a cock-and-bull story of Professor Watkins being at a delicate stage of his work and refusing to see anyone.
		The Doctor is immediately suspicious, noticing that the inhuman Vaughn never blinks once during their meeting.
		The Doctor and Jamie are abducted by two strangers, and taken to a military transport aircraft housing a complete operations room, where they are reunited with Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart from The Web of Fear, now promoted to Brigadier, who is in charge of a military taskforce known as UNIT.
		He explains that he is investigating IE, because whenever people visit the IE offices they are strangely different afterwards.
		He also reveals that the lorry driver they met is a UNIT operative, and that he has disappeared.
		The Doctor and Jamie discover that Zoe and Isobel have fallen into Vaughn's hands.
		They return to IE, finding Zoe's feather boa among a consignment of packing cases being loaded onto a train, but are captured by the security chief, Packer.
		Vaughn denies kidnapping Zoe and Isobel, and suggests they meet the train on its arrival at the company's country compound.
		Overhearing Packer ordering the guards to take Zoe and Isobel to the tenth floor, the Doctor and Jamie rescue them.
		The Doctor uses a radio transceiver given him by the Brigadier to obtain assistance from UNIT, who send a helicopter to airlift them to freedom.
		Realising how dangerous UNIT are to his plans, Vaughn exercises hypnotic control over Major General Rutlidge, and orders him to cease UNIT's investigation.
		The Doctor examines photographs of UFOs over the IE factory, and reasons that these are bringing the mysterious cocoons to Earth.
		They warn the Brigadier that a Cyber army lies hidden somewhere on Earth.
		But they are too late; Rutlidge has already shut down the UNIT investigation.
		The Doctor suspects that the Cybermen are hidden in the sewers beneath the city.
		Vaughn tests Watkins' cerebratron machine on an awakened Cyberman.
		Vaughn is satisfied.
		He now has a weapon he can use against the Cybermen, to maintain his control over them after the invasion.
		The Doctor is desperately working on a device to block the cyber control signal.
		Isobel, Zoe and Jamie venture into the sewers to obtain proof of the Cybermen's presence on Earth, but stumble upon two Cybermen on guard.
		A UNIT squad attempting to reach them are killed.
		They become trapped between the two Cybermen and the insane one, until the latter, being irrational, attacks the other Cybermen: fresh UNIT troops wipe out the surviving Cybermen with hand grenades.
		But Isobel's photos of the Cybermen in the sewers are worthless, as the photographs look too much like fakes.
		UNIT intend to deploy a Russian missile to destroy the source of the signal, while using UK anti-missile-missiles to destroy the incoming Cyberfleet.
		Captain Turner is sent to Russia to organise this, while the Brigadier goes to the RAF's Henlow Downs missile base.
		Vaughn meets his end when his former allies gun him down, but the homing signal is successfully shut off with the help of some UNIT soldiers.
		The megatron bomb is destroyed by an anti-missile-missile, while the Russian rocket destroys the Cybership broadcasting the hypnotic control signal, which had been forced to come in close to the Earth before launching the bomb, as it no longer had the signal of Vaughn's transmitter to aim at.
		Corporal (later Sergeant) Benton of UNIT is introduced in this serial.
		John Levene, who had previously played a Cyberman in The Moonbase and a Yeti in The Web of Fear, would reprise the role of Benton fifteen more times in the series, as well as in the spin-off video Wartime, produced by Reeltime Pictures in 1987.
		The character of Tobias Vaughn reappears in the Virgin New Adventures spin-off novel Original Sin by Andy Lane, in which he meets the Seventh Doctor.
		Vaughn is the Chairman of a powerful company called "Interstellar Nanotomic", which is an anagram of "International Electromatics".
		He says that instead of dying at the conclusion of "The Invasion", his consciousness was transmitted via a satellite into one of fourteen identical robot copies of himself that he uses to influence the people of Earth from behind the scenes.
		The Cybermen mention having encountered the Doctor previously on "Planet 14".
		The identity of "Planet 14" is uncertain, and has been the subject of much fan discussion and speculation.
		In an essay in About Time, a critical analysis of classic Doctor Who, Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood suggest that Planet 14 may be Telos, placing that planet as the fourteenth in the Solar System, after Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mondas, Mars, the time-looped planet mentioned in Image of the Fendahl, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, "Cassius" (mentioned in The Sun Makers as a planet beyond Pluto) and "Xena" (a name popularly used for the dwarf planet Eris prior to its official naming; in the essay, Miles and Wood confuse it with Sedna, another trans-Neptunian object discovered by the same team of astronomers).
		In the Grant Morrison scripted Doctor Who Magazine comic strip story The World Shapers (DWM #127-#129, sometime in late 80s early 90s), it was revealed that the Doctor who met the Cybermen on Planet 14 was the Sixth Doctor along with Jamie and Peri, and that Planet 14 was Marinus.
		Jamie states that he was taught a trick by the Doctor to retain his memories against the mind-wipe performed on him by the Time Lords in "The War Games".
		That story, taking place prior to The Tenth Planet in Cyber-history, also stated that the Voord evolved into the Cybermen and that Marinus eventually became Mondas, the Cyberman homeworld.
		As with all Doctor Who tie-in media, the relationship of the comic strips to the ongoing story of the TV series is open to interpretation.
		Dialogue places The Invasion about four years after The Web of Fear, which further dialogue places about forty years after The Abominable Snowmen (which still further dialogue places in 1935).
		The Invasion is set in the 1970s, and no earlier than Spring 1969.
		Indeed, the story was intended to have a "near future" setting, nevertheless, dating has never been consistently applied.
		When Episode 1 was originally broadcast, the on-air BBC continuity announcer stated immediately before the episode began that it was set in the year 1975.
		In the real 1975, when the serial Pyramids of Mars was broadcast, the character Sarah Jane Smith had a line of dialogue in episode 2 where she told Lawrence Scarman that she came from 1980.
		The episodes were thus generally thought of as being set 5 or more years in the future.

		She panics and runs away from the theater, where the special is shot.
		Outside, it is snowing.
		Kelly encounters a man begging on the street with a little girl.
		The man turns out to be Chad and the girl is his little sister, Poppy.
		When he sees that Kelly is cold, he gives her his coat and takes her to a shelter where he lives now.
		Kelly is moved when she sees all the homeless children who live there.
		Chad give some sweets to the children and Poppy gives her own candy cane to Kelly.
		Kelly is touched by her generosity and realizes that she was wrong and that Christmas is not about her career.
		Having nothing else to give, she sings "White Christmas" to the people in the shelter.
		When she finishes, Chad tells her that he managed to get George Clooney on the phone and that he was available for the special.
		Much to his surprise, Kelly only wishes Merry Christmas to Clooney and hangs up.
		Meanwhile, a video of Kelly singing "White Christmas" has gone viral on YouTube, having more than 25 million views, and the fact is announced by Matt Lauer.
		When the celebrities who refused to participate in the special before see it, they call Kelly as they want to be a part of the show now.
		Nevertheless, Kelly does not pick up her phone.
		Instead she invites Poppy and her new Boston and Seattle friends to join her on stage and sing "Underneath the Tree".
		When Kelly heads home after the performance, she meets Blake Shelton who is wearing an elf costume.
		He bitterly yells at her for not including him into her special, claiming that he is "way too cool for this".
		The story ends with the narrator saying "and they all lived happily ever after" to which Kelly replies "for the most part, anyway" and winks at the camera.

		Cindy, short for Cinderella, lives with her widowed stepmother and two stepsisters, Bertha and Ertha.
		Cindy is forced to do all of the housework and is effectively a servant.
		The widow hates Cindy because when her late Grandfather died, he hid his will which the widow knows passes all the family inheritance to Cindy.
		The widow purposely keeps Cindy busy so that she won't find the will, giving the widow time to find it first.
		The widow is also planning to marry her favorite daughter, Bertha, to a handsome young man named Phillipe, though he is smitten with Cindy.
		One night, Cindy falls asleep before finishing her chores, but an old lady sneaks into the house to finish the chores for her.
		Ertha, Cindy's kinder stepsister, encounters the old lady, who reveals that she is Cindy's Grandmother, and was kicked out of the house by the widow after Grandfather died.
		The same thing happens the following night, but the widow wakes up and chases Grandmother away.
		Ertha, who witnessed everything, tells Cindy about it.
		The widow is afraid that Grandmother will help Cindy find the will.
		Following the advice of her magic mirror, the widow puts on a salesman disguise and visits Grandmother in the woods, tricking her into entering The Castle of a Hundred Doors, from which there is no escape.
		Cindy, dressed in a red riding hood, arrives at Grandmother's cottage too late and is chased away by a "wolf", which is actually the widow in disguise.
		Cindy sits by a lake, telling her hopes to an ugly duckling, unaware that Phillippe is listening.
		Phillippe reveals himself and gives her a ring as a token, but their meeting is interrupted by the widow, who orders Cindy to work.
		While in the barn, Cindy discovers the widow's wolf costume and realizes what happened.
		Bertha, who is jealous of Cindy, chases the pigs away from the farm and blames Cindy for it.
		Ertha advises Cindy to escape to Grandmother's cottage, which she does.
		There Cindy discovers seven wooden dwarfs and one wooden puppet Pinocchio.
		They come alive when she kisses them, and they tell her that widow took Grandmother away.
		The widow wants Cindy back at the house working for her.
		She discovers Cindy's music box and decides to lure her back by holding a masked ball.
		Cindy wants to go, as it is a chance to see Phillippe.
		The dwarfs make her a costume, but warn her that since her mask is made of snow it will melt at midnight.
		At the ball, Cindy's disguise works and she gets to dance with Phillippe.
		Meanwhile, Ertha and Pinocchio dance together.
		When the clock strikes twelve, Cindy's disguise melts and she runs away to escape the widow, her friends following close behind.
		When the widow mocks Ertha for falling for Pinocchio, Ertha retaliates by telling Phillippe that Cindy can be found at Grandmother's house.

		However, Basu tells him, that he's not able to get in the character.
		The frustration of not getting into the required character and drinking too much alcohol causes Akshay to burst out in front of public and media on Pinky, who tells that Ahana had promised sex if he gets her to meet Akshay.
		Akshay publicly humiliates three men and Ahana, by calling them perverts and slut shaming Ahana.
		But this however, backfires on him as he is a Public figure.
		Moreover, he realises his mistake when Lali's wife blames KD and Pinky for this.
		This time, Akshay visits just when three men are about to leave, and asks them to forgive him and meets Ahana to apologise her.
		It is revealed that KD remained a bachelor because he loved Lali's younger sister, who is a divorcee but KD didn't want this to ruin his friendship with Lali.
		Akshay tells Ahana that to rectify his mistake,he has kept a conference, and that he intends to correct their public image.
		He tells in the press conference that he is working in a film Alcoholic, and what he did earlier was a promotional strategy and Lali, KD and Pinky are his uncles and know him from past.
		He also tells that Ahana is the new heroine of the film called "Alcoholic".
		While, the three men happily leave back to India.
		But Akshay finds himself even more frustrated, when he isn't able to get a good shot from Ahana, although he somehow manages to shoot the title track.

	Much as in The Impossible (2012 film), where: 
		Henry Bennett (Ewan McGregor), his wife Maria (Naomi Watts), and their three sons Lucas (Tom Holland), Tomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) go on a Christmas holiday in 2004 to Khao Lak, Thailand.
		Arriving on Christmas Eve, they settle in and begin to enjoy the brand new Orchid Beach Resort.
		Two days later on Boxing Day, the massive 2004 tsunami inundates the area.
		Maria and Lucas eventually emerge from the swirling water and find one another, with Maria having sustained serious injuries to her leg and chest.
		They help a young boy, Daniel, from the wreckage and are soon found by locals who transfer them to a local hospital in the city of Takua Pa.
		Daniel is separated from them during the journey.
		At the hospital, Maria encourages Lucas to help others find their family members while she goes into surgery for her chest injuries.
		Meanwhile, Henry, Thomas and Simon have also survived and are together.
		Henry leaves the two boys with another family who head to the mountains for safe shelter while he stays behind to search for Maria and Lucas.
		While out looking, injured and alone, he is picked up by a passer-by and driven to a nearby bus shelter to wait out with other survivors.
		Communication facilities are scarce but eventually a tourist named Karl (S nke M hring), who has also been separated from his family, lends Henry his cell phone to contact his relatives.
		Henry promises Maria's father he will look everywhere for his family and that he will find them.
		Karl tells the group his wife had left him a note confirming they were at the beach, their location when the wave hit.
		He volunteers to accompany Henry to look for Maria and Lucas and his own family, too.
		While Maria is in surgery, her medical chart is mixed-up with another patient who has died.
		Lucas returns to find his mother's bed empty and is then taken to a tent where children without families are kept safe.
		The mistake is discovered when Lucas cannot identify any of the dead woman's jewelry and he is subsequently reunited with his mother who has been moved to a private room in the ICU.
		In the hospital while he waits, Lucas finds Daniel who has been reunited with his father.
		Henry and Karl search for their families in various places before they arrive at the hospital where Henry is given five minutes to look.
		Karl gives him a piece of paper with his family members names on.
		The vehicle carrying Thomas and Simon also stops outside the hospital and the boys get off so Simon can urinate.
		From a distance, Lucas recognizes his father and while searching him out in the chaotic crowd outside, Lucas' siblings spot him and they reunite.
		Henry finds the three of them together.
		He learns that Maria is in the hospital ready to undergo more surgery for her leg, which she survives.
		Flashbacks reveal how she came to be badly injured and how she surfaced the water.
		While in surgery, Lucas tells his father he has something really important to tell Maria.
		The following day, the family boards an ambulance airplane to Singapore so Maria may receive further medical treatment, arranged by their insurance company.
		On the plane, Lucas tells his mother he knows Daniel is safe.
		Maria looks out the window at the chaos left behind.
 the things
	Much as in Megamind: The Button of Doom, where: 
		For their first day on the job as the new protectors of Metro City after defeating the deranged villain Tighten (Hal Steward's misspelling of "Titan"), Megamind and Minion are selling off their gadgets from their evil lair to the citizens for good purposes (such as the Boot Wheel of Death being sold to a soccer mom, who intends to use it for practice with her soccer team and the Flamethrower being sold to a chef, who intends to use it for cooking his meals).
		All of their items get sold (except for the death ray which Megamind used to "kill" Metro Man in the original film).
		As for the De-Gun (Megamind's weapon of choice used for a number of different destructive functions) it gets sold to a boy named Damien, who accidentally uses it (in its dehydration mode) on his mother and turns her into a cube.
		Megamind tells Damien to soak the cube in water to get her back to normal, but unknown to Megamind, Damien decides not to do it and instead revels in his freedom from his mother.
		After the auction is over, Megamind reveals a suit he created that contains all of Metro Man's powers, which he will wear to protect Metro City.
		Minion finds a seemingly harmless button that had also not had been sold.
		Not knowing what the button does, Megamind pushes the button, and it reveals a giant robot called the Mega-Megamind, which Megamind put his evil self in.
		The robot thinks that Megamind is Metro Man, and starts attacking him.
		Megamind fights the robot with his new powers, but is defeated.
		He and Minion hide in the Invisible Car.
		Megamind decides that they should live in the car from then on, because he programmed the robot to not stop until the hero (and his assistant) is destroyed.
		Minion reveals that he still kept the Spiderbot, a robot that Megamind wanted to throw away, suggesting that Megamind should try to be a hero his way rather than try to do the job the way Metro Man did it.
		Megamind plans to lure the Mega-Megamind to a spot where the Death Ray shoots (the old observatory in which the real Metro Man was lured to in the original movie).
		However, Minion realizes that he cannot activate the Death Ray because the control buttons were broken.
		He then tries to find the Death Ray remote control, but Megamind does not remember what the remote looks like, so Minion tries all the remotes.
		Megamind, trying to hide, eventually is found by the Mega-Megamind (because Minion accidentally played rock music on the Spiderbot).
		Minion finally finds the correct remote and activates the Death Ray.
		Megamind and the Spiderbot get off the robot, using the robot's wrist-mounted shooter just before the robot explodes.
		The duo then recover the De-Gun from Damien, who not only has refused to re-hydrate his mother but also used it on the parents of several other children, who are all now having a party to celebrate no longer having to do as they are told.
		Megamind then re-hydrates the parents with a glass of water to ensure that the children will face punishment for their actions, much to the children's dismay.
		The short ends with Megamind and Minion seeing a signal in the sky (an obvious spoof of the Bat-Signal) and riding off in the Invisible Car as they are called to action.

	Much as in Mr. Monk and the Dirty Cop, where: 
		Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger stop by the University of California to investigate an open-and-shut self-defense murder.
		Professor Jeremiah Cowan was giving a class when a gunman burst into the room and pointed a gun at him.
		Cowan shot the intruder before the intruder could get a shot.
		The shooter's name is Ford Oldman, who apparently made several threats against Cowan in the past.
		Monk explains to Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher how Cowan staged the scene, but before he can explain Cowan's motive, Natalie cuts him off, since the department hasn't paid Monk for his consulting.
		Later that day, Stottlemeyer calls Natalie to say that he has Monk's check at the station.
		Arriving at the station, they notice that the San Francisco Police Department is making large budget cuts.
		It starts when Disher asks if they can break a $20 so he can get a cup of coffee from the machine, which Monk isn't exactly willing to do.
		Stottlemeyer asks Monk to accompany him to the Conference of Metropolitan Homicide Detectives, which this year is being held in San Francisco.
		At the conference, Stottlemeyer reveals several things like Monk's high 120% clearance rate.
		Afterwards, the captain thinks that Paul Braddock, the moderator (and a detective from Banning, California), was simply asking questions that the other cops were thinking.
		He is humiliated, and states that Braddock used to work for the SFPD until Stottlemeyer threatened to expose his abusive methods to Internal Affairs.
		While having coffee with Natalie, Stottlemeyer asks her and Monk to come with him to Mill Valley, where he is planning on checking in on a police informant he once worked with.
		The man's name is Bill Peschel.
		They travel out later that day to meet Peschel, who lives with his daughter Carol, her husband Phil, and their two children.
		He motions them to sit down at his bar.
		It becomes clear that Peschel is diagnosed with dementia because he keeps thinking that he is running his bar.
		Keeping the part, Stottlemeyer acts like Monk is his rookie partner and they are seeking information.
		Peschel first starts by saying that Hy Conrad was in here bragging about a smash-and-grab, but then gets to the point when he tells them that a fancy lady came in asking someone to kill her rich husband and make it look like an accident.
		Leaving Peschel, Natalie is convinced that he is crazy and has Alzheimers, and additionally dementia, since he thinks that this is still the tavern he owned.
		Talking to Carol Atwater, Monk takes an obsession in the Diaper Genie diapers she uses.
		Carol mentions that most cops her father used to know now hang up on him when he calls in late at night with his tips.
		Peschel has also invested big in stock of InTouchSpace, a social networking site.
		When Monk and Natalie arrive at the police station the next day, Stottlemeyer explains that due to the budget issue, Monk's contract as a private consultant has been officially declared void.
		Natalie is infuriated, since she can't get paid unless Monk is paid.
		Disher walks in, informing them that Judge Clarence Stanton was just gunned down in Golden Gate Park.
		Hearing this, Monk prepares to go to the scene, even if no longer a consultant.
		Examining the area outside the crime tape, Monk finds several clues that tell them that the killer is a woman.
		Judging from the impression of the killer's bike, it has a different distance from the seat to the handlebars, and the frame's top tube is at an angle, consistent with that of a woman's bicycle.
		The treads also match those of female running shoes.
		Back at the apartment, Monk (desperate to use his Diaper Genies) "accidentally" creates several messes to prove that the Diaper Genies are great for trash bags.
		Natalie empties the Diaper Genie and walks back in to find Monk talking to the police hotline under assumed names with tips about Judge Stanton's shooting death.
		In the next morning's issue of the San Francisco Chronicle, the article about the shooting explains that Stanton was about to preside over the trial of Salvatore Lucarelli, the West Coast Godfather.
		Monk happens to open to an article about a hit-and-run and calls the police hotline anonymously again.
		This is too much for Natalie, who unplugs the phone suggesting Monk look through the Help Wanted ads.
		As Monk is about to consider becoming a taxicab driver, Stottlemeyer calls to tell Monk to stop sending in anonymous tips, since their caller ID systems traced the calls back to him.
		Just then, someone knocks at the door.
		The man's name is Nicholas Slade, and he is looking to hire Monk and Natalie at his private detective agency, Intertect.
		Slade explains how he used to be a vice detective on the force until ten years ago when he went private and started his agency.
		His agency is essentially a "private eye" in many ways.
		He was at the conference when he witnessed Monk's interview, knowing that Stottlemeyer was about to change the consulting agreement.
		Natalie goes down to the office to fill out paperwork and meets her new office assistant, Danielle Hossack.
		Danielle describes how wonderful Slade is, having made some strategic investments in the stock market and used the profits to start Intertect.
		She even describes the fact that her loyalty is as Slade has instructed her to both Monk and to Natalie.
		She is on their back and on call at any time.
		In short, Natalie is disturbed to find that she is effectively getting what she calls "her own Natalie", since after all Danielle's loyalty is to both of them, although Natalie is still loyal to Monk even though Intertect is now paying her.
		That afternoon, Monk is at work solving the open case files.
		He quickly proves a missing diamond case to be an inside job, and that a spy at a helicopter manufacturing company is using a wheelchair to smuggle secrets to the competition.
		Natalie also trades her Buick Lucerne for a Lexus company car.
		As part of their employment at Intertect, both Monk and Natalie have their own benefits.
		With regards to Monk, Intertect is now paying for his sessions with dr Bell.
		Natalie has a new company car and a new dental plan.
		When Natalie goes into work the next morning, Monk is still there, trying to solve the death of a man who has been stabbed in the chest.
		It's a six-month-old case involving Lou Wickersham, who was killed during a burglary.
		As Natalie informs Danielle that she can't be wheeling in case files to Monk like this, Danielle explains that the police have caught a break in the Stanton case.
		They are focusing on violent offenders Judge Stanton sent to prison and who have been recently released.
		They also pursuing a theory that Salvatore Lucarelli had him killed to avoid trial.
		Going back on the Wickersham case, Monk realizes that the circumstances around where Wickersham's body was found and the lack of defensive wounds don't add up.
		He realizes that it was a suicide, and explains that Wickersham ransacked his own house to hide the fact that he had sold his wife's jewelry and everything valuable to pay off loans.
		He only was able to buy some time.
		The best thing possible for him was to stage a home invasion, and stage his suicide as a murder to guarantee his wife a more comfortable life.
		As Danielle, Monk and Natalie try to debate how to find proof that Wickersham's death was a suicide, Natalie receives a call from Slade.
		Another judge, Alan Carnegie, has been shot dead and the new client has asked specifically for Monk.
		The name of this client is Salvatore Lucarelli.
		Although Natalie says that he would never do that, Slade says that Lucarelli and Monk have met.
		As they are driving towards the jail, Monk explains to Natalie the events of his encounter with Salvatore Lucarelli in the season 3 episode "Mr.
		Monk Meets the Godfather".
		A man named Phil Bedard (who was played in the episode by Devon Gummersall), who worked for the US Mint, walked into a barbershop that was a front for Lucarelli's gambling and protection racket.
		He had stolen some money from his employers, and hidden it in the gumball machine at the shop.
		When the barbershop client tried to intervene as Bedard attempted to retrieve the pennies, Bedard grabbed his gun and fired like a maniac, killing everyone in the room in what was known as the Barbershop Massacre.
		Lucarelli and his men wanted revenge, but as he didn't want to spark a mob war, he pressed Monk and his first assistant Sharona Fleming to clear his name.
		Monk only took the job because the FBI and ATF saw an opportunity to get a man on the inside.
		Although Lucarelli was cleared of any charges, the feds were angry at Monk because he washed and ironed his wired tie, ruining it.
		Now, with Stanton dead, Carnegie was to be the next in line to preside over Lucarelli's trial.
		Carnegie was shot while walking his dog.
		In the interview, Lucarelli says that he only kills lobsters at his restaurant, just like before in the episode.
		When Monk and Natalie arrive at the scene of Judge Carnegie's murder, they find Stottlemeyer and Disher there.
		At first, Stottlemeyer does not understand what Monk is doing looking at the body, since as Monk is no longer working for the SFPD, he shouldn't be crossing the police line.
		Natalie tries explaining otherwise, when Slade arrives.
		Slade suggests that Stottlemeyer reconsider his decision about not joining Intertect, and even tells him that Lucarelli had Monk come out to help.
		He even says that Monk, Natalie and Stottlemeyer would make a great team (which Natalie refers to as the Odd Squad).
		Disher points Monk over to Carnegie's house.
		No one heard any screams or cars screeching away, which allows Monk to close up the murders of Judges Stanton and Carnegie.
		At Carnegie's house, Monk explains to Alan's widow Rhonda that her husband was the alternate to hear the case against Salvatore Lucarelli should something happen to Stanton.
		She wanted her husband's murder to look like a mob hit.
		It is the fact that the Carnegies' dog only barks to strangers that pointed Monk to the widow: If Alan Carnegie was shot dead by a stranger, why didn't the dog bark madly at the shooter.
		The answer can be that Rhonda, who is not a stranger to the dog, shot him.
		After Disher arrests Rhonda Carnegie for the murders, Stottlemeyer thanks Monk for just happening to show up, since otherwise he would have exhausted himself for weeks trying to track down every connection to Lucarelli.
		Unfortunately, they can't rehire Monk as a consultant.
		As soon as Stottlemeyer finishes thanking Monk, Carol Atwater calls the captain to say that Bill Peschel is dead.
		She had left her father to drop off her son at school and drop off her daughter at a pediatrician's appointment.
		Peschel apparently had jumped into the pool and banged his head badly.
		But Monk starts to think otherwise at the crime scene.
		Natalie ditches Monk at dr Bell's office.
		That night, Monk calls Julie to deliver some files to his apartment.
		Natalie convinces her not to.
		When the papers the next morning show the article about Rhonda Carnegie's arrest, Natalie finds it too painful to read all the way through, although she is pleased at the way Slade has twisted the article to improve Intertect's reputation.
		Walking in the door, she finds Monk reviewing more case files.
		Monk just says that he thought Natalie went on vacation, a not-so-smart remark considering how everywhere Natalie goes, Monk goes, and murder follows them (as the novels mr Monk Goes to Hawaii, mr Monk Goes to Germany and mr Monk is Miserable demonstrate).
		When the phone rings, Natalie half expects it to be Slade calling with another case.
		Rather, it is Carol Atwater.
		At the crime scene, Monk and Natalie encounter Carol, Stottlemeyer, Slade and Paul Braddock, the moderator from the conference.
		Natalie finds it odd that Carol married someone with a name similar to her father (Bill being short for William, and Phil being short for Phillip) and asks Monk about it.
		Carol comes over, explaining that Braddock and Slade happened to know her father in the 1990s.
		Stottlemeyer and Braddock's conversation, pleasant to start off, transitions into a brawl when Braddock attacks the captain.
		Slade prevents Stottlemeyer from taking the fight too far.
		Afterwards, Monk observes grass stains on the captain's pants.
		He remembers how Peschel's socks were clean and white, meaning he couldn't have walked across the grass.
		Monk has Natalie stand on the plastic chair that Peschel allegedly stood on.
		When she does, the legs of the chair sink into the grass under her weight.
		The chair Peschel stood on didn't sink its legs into the ground, even when he was twice Natalie's weight.
		Slade uses this claim to snag himself another client.
		They suspect that someone Peschel sent to prison with his tips got released and exacted revenge.
		Meanwhile, Stottlemeyer figures that his career is at risk, since Braddock will probably go back to the convention and he will have to explain his injuries, and he might also twist the story to make Stottlemeyer look like a raging psychopath.
		Monk calls up Danielle to ask her to do some research into Peschel's career.
		She says that he was an early investor into InTouchSpace, the social networking site.
		Natalie explains to Monk that InTouchSpace works like Facebook and MySpace in that you can communicate with other people without leaving the comfort of your house, and that she, Julie, and Adrian's agoraphobic brother Ambrose use it.
		Since Danielle doesn't call back, they take the afternoon off.
		Natalie drops Monk off at dr Bell's place and runs several errands while Monk squeezes in his sessions.
		Of course, dr Bell isn't entirely happy about Monk trying to squeeze in five-minute sessions between his other patients, and suggests to Natalie that she get Danielle to find more open cases for Monk to work on.
		The next morning, dr Bell's hunch comes true when Natalie finds Monk with a cartload of cases that an Intertect employee gave to him.
		Infuriated, she confronts Danielle, but Danielle claims innocence and says that only one person has the authority to send these files over.
		Natalie confronts Slade that what he is doing to Monk is much like killing the goose that laid the golden egg   giving him too much work.
		Returning to Danielle (whom Natalie claims is working not for her but for Slade), Danielle states that Mill Valley's police have confirmed Monk's finds.
		From when Danielle tells Natalie that the death of Bill Peschel has been confirmed by police as a homicide up until Stottlemeyer is arrested, the novel continues to follow Natalie and Monk with Natalie narrating, but also follows a third-person narrated subplot that pursues Lieutenant Disher.
		Randy has given himself the nickname Bullitt, after the film starring Steve McQueen.
		He has started calling Jack Lansdale, a new transfer into the homicide division, "Jackal".
		Stottlemeyer calls to Randy from his office.
		The captain's mood has been getting much worse since the reduced operating budget and the conference.
		Now, Slade has grabbed all of the glory for Rhonda Carnagie's arrest and humiliated the department, and Randy has heard about how Stottlemeyer attacked Braddock.
		The captain tells Randy that he has a new homicide to investigate that will test his ability to lead: it's Braddock himself.
		He was found dead in his hotel room this morning.
		As Disher and Lansdale drive towards the crime scene, Disher reviews the instances of abuse and statements from Braddock's victims.
		Reading the files causes Disher's nausea to reach a point that he vomits into the street in front of a Japanese tour group.
		Examining the crime scene, the medical examiner tells Disher that Braddock died of strangulation.
		Lansdale is a little curious when Disher tells dr Hetzer to look for traces of the comforter.
		Disher explains that things look as though Braddock was being strangled but fought back.
		The killer then pushed Braddock onto the bed and suffocated him.
		At the hotel where Braddock was murdered, Disher has found no surveillance footage of the killer.
		He stops by Stottlemeyer's office to ask him exactly why the file says he was at the Dorchester Hotel the night before.
		Stottlemeyer explains that he was there at 9:30 PM because a cop said that Braddock was taking bribes from gang members running meth labs from their mobile homes in the desert.
		The cop never showed up.
		Disher explains that Braddock died around 10:00 PM, and whoever did it also turned up the air conditioning to prevent anyone from knowing the exact time of death.
		In the meanwhile, Monk has been going through the new case files when Danielle shows up with background information about Bill Peschel.
		Monk was right in that Carol and Phil Atwater aren't a prosperous upper-middle-class family.
		Phil apparently lost his job months ago - he leaves the house each morning with a jacket and a tie but sits in a chair at a Barnes & Noble doing crossword puzzles.
		It seems possible that Carol and her husband planned the murder of her father.
		By posing as an obituary writer, Danielle has gotten more information from Carol about her father's early life.
		He took over the tavern in 1970, and became respected within the police department when he gave them tips to track the people who killed his friend.
		Natalie picks Monk up as they head to the Barnes & Noble where Phil Atwater is sitting during the day.
		Phil is just about to leave when Natalie informs him that they know he was fired months ago.
		It is possible that he murdered his father-in-law for the money, but he quickly is proven to have not been involved.
		However, he is guilty of shoplifting.
		Monk has observed Phil removing many of the anti-theft devices on a Murder, She Wrote novel.
		Phil may not be the killer, but he does provide a rather important tip: ten years ago, Peschel made a lot of money through investment in InTouchSpace.
		Disher finds a file from Forensics on his desk that morning.
		Polyester found on Braddock's neck has been traced back to the Continental, a type of tie sold at Walmart stores.
		Disher remembers seeing that tie before somewhere.
		Feeling nauseous, Disher tells Lansdale to round up several officers and head to Stottlemeyer's apartment to wait for Disher to bring a search warrant.
		As Lansdale and his team search Stottlemeyer's apartment, Disher sits wracked with the guilt of betraying his friend and mentor.
		A detective from Wichita staying in the room next to Braddock's recalls hearing someone enter the room and break a glass.
		The tie found in the trash at the captain's apartment matches the fibers at the crime scene.
		Stottlemeyer still states that he never killed Braddock even with a motive.
		However, it's the captain's fingerprints that are on the glass, and so Disher arrests Stottlemeyer.
		Meanwhile, Monk and Natalie are pursuing the mystery of Steve Wurzel.
		He was motorcycling from San Francisco to Mendocino in the fog, but he never arrived in Mendocino.
		He went missing on the coastal road.
		Natalie finds several strange clues like Wurzel buying Peschel's business and both investing in InTouchSpace.
		It's clear that Monk is suffering from case overload.
		As they drive along, Natalie calls Danielle asking to arrange an appointment with Linda Wurzel.
		Back at the apartment, Monk finishes his Intertect cases while Natalie hones her detective skills by reading Murder, She Wrote.
		The captain calls asking them to come to the jail.
		At first, they think that Lucarelli asked for them, so they are shocked to see Stottlemeyer in a jumpsuit.
		Stottlemeyer explains his situation, asking for Monk to clear his name.
		At police headquarters, Randy has been promoted to Acting Captain and has moved into Stottlemeyer's office.
		Natalie is tempted to slap him, although Disher says he was following the evidence and hopes to clear the captain's name.
		He tells them that they are not allowed to look at the Braddock file, but Monk and Natalie immediately head to the scene of the crime.
		At the hotel, Monk immediately proves that Stottlemeyer is innocent.
		There are four identical drinking glasses in the room, but in the crime scene photos, there are five.
		The fifth glass, the one Stottlemeyer's fingerprints were on, was obviously planted there later.
		As they leave the hotel, they run into Slade in the lobby.
		Slade says they need to talk about how with the way Monk is working, he is eventually going to destroy himself.
		Back at the jail, Stottlemeyer suggests that they look at Braddock's arrest records.
		He tells Monk and Natalie that a closer look at some of these arrests will bring up note that they came with the help of a confidential informant.
		Natalie calls Danielle and has her meet them at Monk's apartment.
		When Danielle enters (and Monk spends 30 minutes washing his hands), Natalie tells Danielle that she has realized how Slade has been using the GPS systems to track her and Monk around on their cases.
		But Danielle also has the information they need on Linda Wurzel and Dalberg Enterprises.
		Linda Wurzel is Dalberg Enterprises - Dalberg being her maiden name.
		She has an office downtown and an estate in Sea Cliff, and three days a week has a standing appointment at JoAnne's beauty salon.
		They meet Wurzel, but after Monk freaks out about the skin cell eating fish, he and Natalie explain how Braddock's murder and Peschel's murder might be connected.
		The use of these creatures to eat dead skin cells is too much for Monk, who borrows Natalie's cell phone and places a call.
		Soon, the Department of Homeland Security arrives, and Monk solves the case.
		However, in a most unusual way, it turns out that Natalie has also solved the case - all she has been in need of is for Monk to tighten all the loose ends.
		Peschel sold his business ten years ago, around the same time that Steve Wurzel vanished on the road.
		Linda Wurzel was their connection.
		At that same time, Slade quit the SFPD, and started Intertect by using the money of his InTouchSpace investment.
		Monk also remembers that on the day that he and Natalie first became private eyes at Intertect, Danielle told them how Slade used his investment money to start the company.
		It is here that Monk is on the same page as Natalie: Slade killed Steve Wurzel, Bill Peschel, and Paul Braddock.
		Monk remembers how Peschel told them, and infers that he probably also told Braddock.
		It proves that Slade killed both of them and framed Stottlemeyer for Braddock's murder.
		As they already know, Peschel worked a tavern in the Tenderloin for several years.
		He was a confidential informant who sold tips to Paul Braddock (who was working with the SFPD then), Nicholas Slade and Leland Stottlemeyer.
		Ten years ago, he sold his place to Linda Wurzel and retired with an InTouchSpace stock investment.
		Natalie remembers how when she, Stottlemeyer and Monk went to see Peschel, he was living in his daughter's house and diagnosed with dementia.
		He thought he was still running his tavern, and that Stottlemeyer and Monk were cops who had come to him seeking information.
		She also remembers Peschel mentioning something about a smash-and-grab and about a rich woman who came in to hire a hit man to kill her husband and make it look like an accident, and she realizes who exactly he was talking about: he was talking about Linda Wurzel.
		In 1998, Linda Wurzel went to Bill's Tavern, seeking a hit man to kill her husband.
		She probably figured that she would increase her odds of getting someone at the tavern.
		Peschel gave the tip to Slade.
		Slade, who was still a detective with the police department, posed as a hit man and met her.
		But instead of arresting her, he realized that this was too good a tip to pass up.
		He ran Steve Wurzel off the road somewhere between San Francisco and Mendocino.
		His body drifted out to sea and was never found.
		Whether or not Peschel helped him, they both got paid.
		Linda Wurzel bought Peschel's bar and gave both of them InTouchSpace stock.
		Slade used the investment to start Intertect.
		Everyone was happy, that is until Peschel became senile and started calling his police friends with ten-year-old tips.
		Slade could not take the risk that Stottlemeyer or Braddock would piece together what Peschel was telling them.
		He realized that they had seen too much, so he had to silence them by any means possible.
		Taking care of Peschel was the easiest part, but then Slade had to get Stottlemeyer and Braddock out of the way.
		He was incredibly worried, until he saw Braddock humiliate the captain at the conference.
		He stole Stottlemeyer's glass, being careful not to put his own fingerprints on the glass.
		Slade's luck improved when Monk got fired and Braddock attacked Stottlemeyer at Peschel's wake.
		Knowing how well Monk could break cases without even looking at them, Slade hired him and Natalie and set them to work.
		He was trying to keep them busy and prevent them from knowing what was going on.
		Just before meeting Monk, Natalie and Stottlemeyer at the Alan Carnegie murder scene, Slade killed Peschel.
		He killed him in the house, and threw his body in the pool, and staged the scene to make it look like an accident.
		Braddock was the next on Slade's list of people to be eliminated.
		The night after Stottlemeyer attacked Braddock at the wake, Slade dressed himself in a beefeater suit, and took the elevator up to the seventh floor.
		Intertect was the company responsible for security, so people naturally thought that he could have been there for some other matter.
		He brought with him the glass carrying Stottlemeyer's fingerprints, and a tie of the same type and color as the captain's.
		He entered Braddock's room, talked with Braddock for a few minutes, and then strangled him with the Continental tie.
		Braddock, however, fought back, and Slade suffocated him on the bed.
		The sounds that the Wichita detective was hearing from his room were the sounds of the struggle behind the wall.
		Slade planted the glass at the crime scene to frame Stottlemeyer.
		He knew very well that the Captain had thrown out his previous tie earlier that afternoon after Braddock had attacked him - he knew that the blood on the tie would match 100% and that the fibers would match as well.
		He knew very well that Stottlemeyer would have an obvious motive, and even lured him to the hotel by faking the phone call, that way, the Captain would have an alibi for the time of the murder.
		No one in the department, not even Disher, would suspect Slade as being involved.
		Monk realizes however that they cannot prove any of this.
		Natalie realizes that either Linda Wurzel will talk to Slade and say they met her, or that Slade is tracking them.
		Natalie explains how she discovered the tracking devices in the GPS and the keylogger programs of their computers, and the possibility that the phones have wiretaps placed on them.
		Not wanting Slade to know where they have been, Monk tells Natalie to call Julie and have her meet them at his apartment.
		He instructs Julie to drive the Lexus across town so that Slade will be distracted.
		In the meanwhile, Monk and Natalie will switch out the Lexus for Natalie's own car.
		He also has Danielle meet them in her own car.
		Monk, Natalie and Danielle make their way to Linda Wurzel's street for what will be Danielle's first stakeout.
		Shortly after they park, Wurzel arrives.
		During the stakeout, Natalie turns her attention to the Braddock case.
		It's clear that Slade was the guy in the beefeater suit on the elevator tape, but it doesn't prove he was at the hotel at the same time that Stottlemeyer was.
		After all, Slade could have created a false pretense as to why he was at the hotel that night, since Intertect is responsible for the hotel's security, and he could have erased himself from the tapes.
		When Wurzel pulls out heading towards Danielle's car, Natalie gives her a call.
		They follow Wurzel across town to Mission Bay and an abandoned warehouse.
		Parking a short distance away, Monk and Natalie sneak into the warehouse, Natalie muting her cell phone and setting it on speed dial so that they won't be seen.
		They observe Wurzel talking to Slade.
		When Slade pulls a gun with a silencer, Monk steps out to confront him.
		Slade asks them who is driving his Lexus all over Berkeley, which causes Natalie to forget about the case and ask herself what Julie is doing that far away in the middle of the night.
		Monk explains to Slade that killing Steve Wurzel was his undoing.
		He was the only person who attended the conference who knew Peschel, Braddock and Stottlemeyer.
		Slade turns his gun at them and is about to shoot when Danielle leaps from a pile of bricks and knocks the gun out of his hand.
		Natalie snatches up the gun, aiming it at Slade, who now threatens to break Danielle's neck.
		Slade taunts Natalie, saying that she can't shoot a gun, although Natalie has been trained in firearms and met Monk after she killed an intruder in her house.
		Slade releases Danielle just as Disher and the police arrive to arrest him and Wurzel for their crimes.
		Disher congratulates Monk for his work and clearing Stottlemeyer's name.
		The open 9-1-1 call is as good as any confession.
		Monk disinfects the Captain's office before it is put to use.
		Stottlemeyer is exonerated and goes back at work.
		He is constantly repeating some of the things Natalie said on the open 9-1-1 call, and says that she'll be soon called "Dirty Natalie".
		He accepts Disher's apologies, but tells him that he was just doing his job.
		Later, Stottlemeyer shows up later at Monk's apartment to officially say that Monk is back on their payroll as a consultant.
		He got the chief to reconsider by using political blackmail, threatening to explain his story to the TV stations if Monk wasn't rehired and the old budget brought back.
		With regards to the trial, Slade happened to be wearing a wire when he met Linda, and he has kept a recording of their conversation ever since for insurance.
		Monk prepares to return to being a consultant to the San Francisco Police Department, the position he really belongs in.

	Much as in Compulsion (2009 film), where: 
		Compulsion tells the story of Anjika Indrani, a wealthy young Cambridge graduate who is in a secret relationship with fellow graduate, Alex.
		Anjika s father, Satvick, forces her into an arranged marriage with a business associate s son, Hardick.
		Satvick s chauffeur, Don Flowers, realises Anjika is not happy with her father s plans and says he will help her out, on the condition she spends the night with him.
		Anjika hates him, so she refuses at first, but reluctantly agrees eventually.
		Hardick collapses on a date with Anjika, and Flowers seizes the opportunity and takes him back to his flat, scattering illegal drugs everywhere, making Hardick look like a dealer.
		Anjika s parents call off the marriage, but Flowers reminds her she needs to keep up her end of the deal.
		Reluctant, she visits the hotel room Flowers booked and allows him to flirt with her, touch her and smell her, before the pair have sex.
		Anjika wakes up the next morning and quickly leaves; Flowers awakes and thanks her.
		Things are not simple from then on.
		Anjika makes up the excuse that if Flowers stops providing her brother with drugs, she will bed him again.
		Flowers realizes Anjika has feelings for him, and makes her beg to take her to bed.
		The pair continue in their affair, obviously strongly loving each other.
		Things complicate, however, when Alex and Anjika reveal their relationship and her parents strongly approve, even arranging a marriage for the two.
		Anjika becomes stressed, realizing her heart belongs with Flowers despite the age difference, yet she s in denial and insists she still loves Alex.
		Hardick returns and blames his messed up life on Alex, however realises Anjika is to blame.
		Anjika and Flowers have just had sex when Hardick arrives.
		He grabs Anjika but a messy Flowers appears, warning Hardick away.
		Hardick realizes the two had sex, but before he can speak Flowers strangles and kills him.
		Anjika s life continues to go downhill.
		Her affair with Flowers continues.
		Flowers presents her with a bracelet, however she says she can t wear it.
		Anjika and her friend are collected from a nightclub and Anjika writes a flirtatious text; when asked by her friend she says it s for Alex, however she is caught sending it to Flowers.
		Alex discovers this and confronts Anjika, she denies anything with Flowers.
		Realizing the affair has gone way out of hand, Anjika prepares a knife for her latest date with Flowers.
		The two have sex but Anjika remains hesitant, saying she could get Flowers done for rape.
		Flowers is shocked but admits he loves Anjika and insists that she loves him too, which she does.
		Flowers then continues to have sex with her, although this time, Anjika pleads him not to.
		Flowers devastated and in love, puts the knife in her hand and begins stabbing himself in the stomach and then, caught in the moment, Anjika begins stabbing furiously into his side.
		She phones the police and says she s killed a rapist.
		The next shot is of Anjika and Alex emerging from their wedding.
		Anjika seems less than thrilled but puts on a brave smile.

	Much as in Plumbers Don't Wear Ties, where: 
		A full motion video clip features the character Jane introducing the player to the main objective and basic rules of the game.
		From that point onwards the entire format is that of still photographs with actors reading dialogue.
		The narrator also changes once during the game, before being changed back to the original a few scenes later.
		In the early 1990s, Los Angeles locals John (Edward Foster) and Jane (Jeanne Basone), originally from Almonte, Ontario, are both being pressured by their respective parents to find a suitable spouse.
		John, a plumber, is told by his mother (Violetta Gevorkian, voiced by Samantha Eggersoll) to go to her house with John's current girlfriend, Amy, for dinner at 6:00 pm.
		College student Jane, meanwhile, who is considered a "daddy's girl", is going to a job interview, having disliked her coworkers at her previous job.
		John and Jane both meet in a parking lot by 8:00 AM, and John instantly falls in love with Jane, calling her "perfect".
		John decides not to go to work and stays in the parking lot to wait for Jane to leave from her job interview so he can meet Jane again, thinking it is more important than his job, possibly due to the fact of his mother's wanting of a spouse for him.
		Around this time, it is revealed that the game is being narrated by Harry Armis (who also played Jane's father).
		When Jane is at the interview, her prospective boss, Paul Mark Thresher (Paul Bokor), tells her that, despite her outstanding qualifications and recommendations, her position was cancelled an hour before.
		When Jane gets very upset about this, Mark says that "something can be worked out, after all," and asks her to take her clothes off, which appears to be an attempt to lead Jane to have sex with him to get a job.
		However, when Jane refuses, Mark attempts to rape her and eventually Jane runs away from him.
		When John finds her being chased by Mark, John comes in and saves her, and Mark, Jane and John end up in the middle of an abandoned house.
		Around this time, Harry Armis is replaced by a female narrator named Wilma (Thyra Metz).
		She is shot multiple times by Armis, who then returns as narrator.
		After the chase, Mark tries to pay Jane $5 million for sex.
		If Jane accepts this offer, it also would force John to have to marry Amy and have 3 kids to please his mother, and Jane to be turned into a prostitute.
		Jane refuses, after John tells him that Jane loves him, and that she wants to marry him for a lifetime.
		John and Jane both walk out of the house and Mark is going to get arrested after calling the police, and John and Jane return to the parking lot where they first met.
		Several possible endings exist in the game.
		If John doesn't fight with Mark in the parking lot, Mark will seduce John, and they two will suddenly become a couple, before the game tells the player that they cannot be gay and should try again.
		If John decides to fight Mark in the parking lot, to help protect Jane, a few different alternative endings become possible.
		If the "Hollywood Ending" is chosen, John defeats Mark and refuses to become a pimp.
		As a reward for being honorable, Jane decides to treat John to dinner and they travel to her place on John's bike.
		While he attempts to tell her that his profession is that of a plumber, Jane believes he is joking, then replies, "Plumbers don't wear ties".
		If the "Gimme Something Completely Different" is selected instead, Jane confesses to John that she is still a virgin and plans to become a nun, much to John's surprise.
		After failing to talk her out of it, John is forced to return home to have dinner with his mother who arranges a shotgun wedding between him and Amy.

	Much as in Relativity Theory (The Outer Limits), where: 
		Biologist Teresa Janovitch is a civilian among military men, traveling on the Resource Survey Vehicle Cortez to Tau Ceti Prime in search of minerals for an Earth that has squandered its own.
		Initial signs indicate that the planet is both uninhabited and rich in mineral resources, which could mean a million dollar payday for both the crew and the company that owns the Cortez.
		But on the first exploration, the crew is attacked by gigantic and apparently primitive aliens.
		After initial casualties, command of the mission technically, by regulations, falls to Janovitch, who favors further investigation and a non-aggressive approach towards the aliens; it may be possible to either reach some accommodation with the aliens or find an area of the planet where they do not live to extract resources.
		But she is overpowered by her crew, Sgt.
		Adam Sears, a veteran of pacification missions on Earth, who favors annihilation of the new race, and Corporal Charles Pendelton; the crew are impatient with the idea of negotiating with alien savages after they have been responsible for killing members of their crew, and greedy to claim their reward for finding a planet so rich in resources.
		Despite her protests, Sears essentially mutinies against Janovitch and leads a patrol that hunts down and kills the aliens, in the process seizing a golden object that appears to be a religious totem, knowing that his actions will not be held against him if Earth profits from the planet's resources.
		As he celebrates his slaughter, Janovitch examines his victims and makes a shocking discovery.
		Before she can communicate it, a highly advanced alien vessel (far more advanced than the human team's own ship) emerges from a wormhole, with a member of the "primitive" alien race on board.
		Janovitch angrily reveals that her medical examination of the corpses showed that the "primitive" aliens were juveniles; they did not bear advanced technology with them because they were essentially an alien Boy Scout team on a camping trip.
		The "religious" totem was an emergency radio.
		Having downloaded the location of the homeworld of these bloodthirsty aliens that would murder children from their ship's computer, this "father" then sends a bomb killing the remaining crew.
		The closing scene shows the alien ship approaching Earth ready to attack.

		He is a Japanese actor who, in broken German, says that he must talk to the old woman.
		The priest tries to hush him, but the old woman tells him to come in.
 getting married without each
	Much as in To Sail Beyond the Sunset, where: 
		The book is a memoir of Maureen Johnson Smith Long, mother, lover, and eventual wife of Lazarus Long.
		Maureen is ostensibly recording the events of the book while held in prison alongside Pixel, the eponymous character of The Cat Who Walks Through Walls.
		Maureen, born on July 4, 1882, recounts her girlhood in backcountry Missouri, discovery that her family is a member of the long-lived Howard Families (whose backstory is revealed in Methuselah's Children), marriage to Brian Smith, another member of that group, and her life largely in Kansas City until her apparent death in 1982.
		In addition, Maureen lives through, and gives her (sometimes contradictory) viewpoints on many events in other Heinlein stories, most notably the 1917 visit from the future by "Ted Bronson" (Lazarus Long), told from Long's point of view in Time Enough for Love, Harriman's space program from The Man Who Sold the Moon, and the rolling roads from The Roads Must Roll.
		The adventures of Maureen include a series of sexual encounters, beginning in childhood wherein, having just had her first sexual intercourse, is examined by her father, a doctor, and finds herself desiring him sexually.
		Her story then encompasses various boys, her husband, ministers, other women's husbands, boyfriends, swinging sessions, and the adult Lazarus Long/Theodore Bronson.
		Additionally, she continues a lifelong pursuit of her father sexually, encourages her husband to have sexual intercourse with their daughters, and accompanies him when he does; but forbids a son and daughter of hers from continuing an incestuous relationship, primarily for the sister's reluctance to share the brother with other women.
		All of these are set against a history lesson of an alternate 20th century in which a variety of social and philosophical commentary is delivered.
		She is eventually rescued by Lazarus Long and other characters of various novels in the ship Gay Deceiver (from The Number of the Beast), and after rescuing her father from certain death in the Battle of Britain, is united with her descendants in a massive group marriage in the settlement of Boondock, on the planet Tertius.

The novel then switches to
	Much as in 976-EVIL, where: 
		The movie centers around cousins Spike (Patrick O'Bryan) and Hoax (Stephen Geoffreys), both teenagers who live with Hoax's overtly religious mother Lucy (Sandy Dennis).
		While Spike is the neighborhood motorcycle bad boy, Hoax is an introverted nerd.
		Even though Spike genuinely cares for his cousin and protects him from bullies, Hoax is filled with resentment that he cannot stand up for himself or get the girl he wants (both of which Spike does effortlessly).
		Both boys stumble upon 976-EVIL, which on the surface is just a novelty phone line that gives creepy-themed fortunes for a few dollars.
		However, the line is actually used by Satan to subtly corrupt mortals into his bidding.
		Spike loses interest in the line quickly, but Hoax soon discovers the true nature of the line and uses it to get revenge on everyone who has wronged him.
		Soon Hoax's spirit is almost entirely consumed by Satan, who possesses Hoax to cause death and destruction, culminating in an opening to Hell appearing before their house.
		Spike confronts Hoax, but is quickly overpowered.
		In a desperate last ploy, he calls earnestly to his cousin, reminding him of the plans they had to take a vacation that summer.
		Hoax's fleeting soul resurfaces briefly, and realizes his horrible mistake and embraces Spike, begging for help.
		Spike, realizing Hoax is lost and cannot be separated from the demonic presence, betrays his cousin and throws him into the pit of Hell.

		In Victorian-era London lives a young boy named Ciel Phantomhive.
		Ciel lives with his wealthy parents in a manor in England.
		On the night of his tenth birthday, Ciel comes across his mother, father, and dog dead and surrounded by flames.
		The manor was set on fire, and he is captured by cultists.
		He is sold by his kidnappers, and then given a mark on his abdomen that's supposed to be the mark of a "noble beast".
		After enduring a month of excruciating and humiliating torture, Ciel unknowingly summons the demon, who he names Sebastian after his childhood dog.
		Ciel returns to the Phantomhive household with an enigmatic black-clad butler, Sebastian Michaelis.
		To others, it seems that the butler is simply the best at his craft, from anticipating his young master's needs to carrying them out to the best of his inexplicable abilities.
		In truth, Sebastian is actually a demon that has entered into a contract with Ciel.
		In exchange for the boy's soul, the demon will help him exact revenge on those who have wronged him.

		Helena is the matriarch of a fictional contemporary British royal family who must struggle with both common and atypical family dramas while in the public eye.
		Twins Prince Liam and Princess Eleanor enjoy the hedonistic pleasures available to them as royals, knowing that their older brother Robert bears the responsibility of being heir to the throne of England.
		But when Robert is killed, the family is thrown into disarray and a grieving King Simon fears for the future of the monarchy.
		Unexpectedly next in line for the throne, Liam must adjust to his new role while navigating his attraction to Ophelia, the American daughter of the royal head of security.
		His self-destructive sister Eleanor finds rock-bottom when her bodyguard turns out to be a conman.
		Trying to preserve the status quo and keep the royal family under her control, Queen Helena allies herself with Simon's brother Cyrus to preserve their way of life at any cost.
 extremely distracted at work and at home his mother
	Much as in British Agent, where: 
		In the days leading up to the Russian Revolution, Stephen Locke (Leslie Howard), a minor British diplomat, watches rioting in the streets.
		Revolutionary Elena Moura (Kay Francis) shoots it out with a Cossack soldier; when she retreats onto the grounds of the consulate, the soldier follows, forcing Stephen to intervene to protect British extraterritoriality.
		After the Cossack leaves, Elena emerges; she and Steven are attracted to each other, but their politics clash.
		Elena departs.
		After the Russian Empire is overthrown and the Soviet Union is born, most of the Western diplomats evacuate.
		Stephen is left behind with just a servant, "Poohbah" Evans.
		Day after day, he waits with mounting frustration for instructions, passing the time with others in the same situation, American Bob Medill (William Gargan), Gaston LeFarge (Phillip Reed) and Tito Del Val (Cesar Romero).
		His boredom is lifted when he meets Elena again.
		She is now an important member of the government, working for Commissioner of War Trotsky (J.
		Carrol Naish).
		He romances her, and they quickly fall in love.
		However, her first loyalty is to her country.
		She demonstrates this when Stephen finally receives orders from England.
		He is to try to prevent the Soviet Union from concluding a separate peace with Imperial Germany, which would free up large numbers of German soldiers for the Western Front; however, he is warned that he is only an "unofficial" British representative.
		Stephen carelessly reads the message in Elena's hearing.
		She passes along the information to her boss.
		As a result, when Stephen pleads with the Soviet government in Moscow to keep fighting, his arguments are undercut by their awareness of his status.
		He manages to get a delay of three weeks, to see if he can persuade his superiors to agree to Soviet demands:  50 million, five army divisions and munitions.
		Instead, without Stephen's knowledge, the British send a force to Archangel to fight alongside the internal enemies of the Soviets.
		After the Czar is executed, Medill, LeFarge and Del Val persuade Stephen to join them in supporting counterrevolutionary forces.
		When Lenin is seriously wounded in an assassination attempt, the Soviets initiate a harsh crackdown.
		LeFarge and Del Val are killed while attempting to contact a rebel military leader in the city.
		Medill tries to do the same, but is caught and tortured for Stephen's whereabouts.
		When he refuses to crack, he is sentenced to die by firing squad the next day.
		Elena is ordered to persuade him to tell her where Stephen is; knowing she is in love with Stephen, Medill gives her the address.
		She reluctantly gives the information to Trotsky, who orders soldiers to level the building.
		Elena sneaks into the building, determined to die with Stephen.
		They are reprieved, however.
		Just as the soldiers start shooting, news arrives that Lenin will recover, and that he has ordered the release of all political prisoners.
		Later, Stephen and Elena depart for England; at the train station, Medill requests they send him a supply of bubble gum.
 confronts him that he needs to stop living in the past and he needs to get over Khirad and all the hurt and pain
	Much as in The Dresser (1983 film), where: 
		The plot is based on Harwood's experiences as dresser to English Shakespearean actor-manager Sir Donald Wolfit, who is the model for the character "Sir".
		The film opens with a performance of Othello at a regional theatre in the United Kingdom during World War II.
		In the title role is an ageing, once-famous Shakespearean actor identified to us only as "Sir" (Albert Finney).
		He is of the old, bombastic school of British acting, full of grand gestures and fine oratory.
		As the curtain comes down on the last act, and as the actors line up for their curtain call, Sir lectures them on the mistakes they've made during the performance, showing us that he is the leader of this travelling band of actors bringing Shakespeare to the provinces during wartime.
		Waiting backstage is Norman (Tom Courtenay), who has been Sir's dresser for decades.
		Norman is an efficient, somewhat effeminate little man who knows Sir's every whim and fancy, is used to his tirades and temperamental rants and is, for all intents and purposes, Sir's servant.
		As Norman waits for Sir to come offstage after a typically florid closing address to the audience, we see one way he copes with his job as he takes a nip from a handy little bottle of brandy always in his back pocket.
		The company is hurrying to its next venue, the industrial town of Bradford, where Sir is to give his renowned portrayal of the title character in King Lear.
		The train nearly leaves without them, as Sir makes his stately progress through the train station to the platform, Norman scurrying ahead to plead with the train guard to hold the train for Sir's arrival.
		But the train begins to pull out of the station, until Sir delivers a loud, commanding "STOP.
		THAT.
		TRAIN.
		" from the platform steps.
		The guard, taken aback, does just that and Sir placidly leads his company aboard.
		Arriving in Bradford, however, another source of Norman's anxiety soon becomes clear, for it becomes obvious that Sir's mental capacities are rapidly fading.
		Norman rescues him from a confused, almost violent rant in the town square that lands Sir in the hospital.
		As the company tries to decide what to do, Sir unexpectedly arrives at the theatre, disoriented and exhausted, saying he has checked himself out of the hospital.
		Norman ushers Sir to the dressing room, fiercely resisting the stage manager's insistence that the show be canceled and insisting Sir will be ready to go on.
		The middle section of the film takes place nearly entirely in the dressing room, as Norman struggles to prepare Sir for the curtain.
		Sir's wandering mind and nearly incoherent ramblings gradually become more focused as Norman gets him to concentrate on applying his makeup, remembering his lines; and we see how dependent the two men are on each other.
		Sir would have no career left without Norman; Norman, even worse, would have no life without Sir, to whom he has so long dedicated all his time and energy.
		By the time Sir's wife, referred to only as "Her Ladyship", who is playing Cordelia to her husband's Lear, arrives in the dressing room for the five-minute call, Sir is ready for the role he has only performed 227 times.
		The curtain rises for the opening dialogue among Lear's courtiers, but Sir seems to mentally drift away while waiting for his cue, much to Norman's distress, forcing the hapless actors on stage to improvise speeches while Norman struggles to convince Sir of his entrance.
		Air raid sirens sound, signaling the onset of an air raid; and, indeed, distant bombs that can be heard falling seem to rouse Sir and he strides on stage to deliver what all agree is his finest portrayal of Lear in his long career.
		After the triumphant performance, however, Sir collapses from exhaustion and Norman helps him to his dressing room to lie down.
		Sir requests Norman to read from an autobiography he claims to have been writing.
		Although all Sir has written is the opening dedication, Norman reads aloud Sir's gracious "thank you"'s to his audiences, his fellow actors, to Shakespeare, to stage technicians.
		but not a word about his dresser who has served him so long and loyally.
		About to protest, Norman discovers that Sir has died while he's been reading.
		Norman, by now slightly drunk from the evening's brandy nips, flies into a rage, accusing Sir of being a thankless old sod, and in his anger even madly scribbles an addition to Sir's writing thanking himself.
		But Norman's anger only temporarily covers his disorientation at losing the only life he has known for so many years and, as Norman tearfully admits, the only man he has ever loved.
		The film closes with Norman sprawled across Sir's body, unwilling to let go of his life and his love.

	Much as in Drifters (2011 film), where: 
		For the young Mete (graphologist fascinated by the psychology hidden behind writing), it's an embarrassing and difficult situation having to take care of his half-sister Belinda, a seventeen-year-old teenager in the balance between everything and nothing, during the second marriage of Mete's father (the only point shared between the two).
		To avoid the situation, Mete pretends to be mostly busy with Damiano, a womanizer friend, and Bruno, colleague and father separated.
		But Mete must decide to face his half-sister, a subject hitherto only grazed.

		Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon (Jim Parsons), Howard (Simon Helberg) and Raj (Kunal Nayyar) are heading to San Francisco to attend a conference, where cosmologist George Smoot is giving a keynote address.
		On Sheldon's insistence, they travel on the Coast Starlight train.
		On board the train, they learn that Summer Glau (played by herself) is riding the same train.
		Raj and Howard debate on who should approach her first.
		With Raj unable to talk to women except when under the influence of alcohol, he departs to find alcohol on the train.
		As Howard is trying to figure out the best opening line, Raj swoops in and starts talking with Summer (even using the same line Howard planned to use: "It's hot in here, it must be Summer").
		Their conversation is going very well (Howard commenting, "Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato.
		Put one beer in him, and he s Night Charmalarmalon".
		) However, Howard then points out to Raj that he is drinking non-alcoholic beer, after which he realizes he was under a sort of placebo effect, and quickly departs the scene, unable to talk anymore.
		Howard tries to strike a conversation but is unable to create an impression; instead he just comes off as annoying.
		Finally he asks to have his picture with her to which she agrees until he gets annoying again and she breaks his phone.
		With the failure of both Raj and Howard, Leonard musters the courage to approach Summer, but she gets off the train as he is introducing himself.
		During the train ride, Sheldon realizes that he has forgotten the flash drive containing the paper he wanted Smoot to read.
		Reluctantly, he resorts to asking Penny (Kaley Cuoco) to actually enter his bedroom and locate his flash drive so she can email him the paper.
		When Sheldon eventually presents the paper to Smoot (appearing as himself) and proposes joint research on the subject, Smoot rejects his idea, leaving Sheldon to think Smoot is a diva.

		Although Callie's brother John (Graham) and sister-in-law Wanda (Atkinson) attempt to help them, the abusive Ray (the father of youngest child Jason) has no interest in working, and Callie rebuffs Wanda's suggestion that she continue treatment for the manic depression she suffers from.
		As a result, the family soon finds themselves living in poverty, with oldest child Jessi (Randall) forced to play mother to her younger sisters (Julie, Susan, and Cindy) and brother.
		A short time later, Ray leaves them, and Callie continues on a downward spiral.
		Sensing his sister has some serious problems, John notifies the authorities, who send social worker Donna Evans (Barnes) to the house.
		After initially attempting to avoid her, Callie agrees to undergo treatment for her disorder, on the condition that John and Wanda don't get custody of her children, who are instead taken in by Patty and Harlan Pepper (Struthers and Johnston).
		Between the fact that the children are not only thriving in the Peppers' care, but also referring to them as "Mom" and "Dad", Patty soon becomes determined that she and Harlan win custody, particularly after seeing the effects that the children suffer after their required visits with Callie at the hospital.
		This results in a difficult legal battle, which drags on over a period of two years, and generates much media coverage over the legal system's apparent inability to act in the children's best interest.
		Despite the couple's best efforts, after much consideration, the presiding judge rules that the children be removed from Patty and Harlan's care.
		After a tearful farewell that generates more media attention, the children are placed in the care of the state, during which time they begin receiving therapy.
		During one of these sessions, Julie expresses anger towards her older sister for things not working out, despite Jessi's promise that they would, and tells her she's "just like Callie".
		Later, Jessi tearfully tells her therapist that she tried her hardest, but was overwhelmed by the adult role she attempted to fill.
		Meanwhile, all is not well for Harlan and Patty, whose marriage is deteriorating as a result of the grief caused by the children's removal.
		In a subsequent therapy session, Jessi is joined by Callie, who attempts to explain the reasons for her past erratic behavior, but Jessi is still angry with her mother for everything that happened, and the session abruptly ends when Callie runs from the center.
		After this incident, she subsequently disappears, thus detouring the original plan of eventually returning the children to Callie.
		Nor is there an alternate workable plan, as the current foster placement is only short-term, Harlan and Patty have split, and the kids blame their Uncle John for having them removed.
		Eventually finding Callie in the backseat of his truck, John makes a heartfelt plea for his sister to resume treatment, promising to care for her kids as if they were his own, and she finally agrees to do so.
		Callie then explains the situation to the kids, who ask why their Uncle John and Aunt Wanda never stepped in to help them before.
		At this point, Callie admits she refused to accept their help because of her illness, but assures the kids that the decision of where they will live is up to them.
		The younger children look to Jessi as to what they should do, but she snaps and tells them she doesn't know everything, and they should just take a vote.
		She then runs after her mother to wish her good luck, making an apparent peace with her, and Callie later bids goodbye to her children as they leave with John and Wanda, whom they have decided to live with.
		The film ends in the same manner as it opened, with the children singing a rendition of "Take Me Home, Country Roads", eventually joined by their aunt and uncle.

		Her partner Bosse is unemployed, and she is left to feed the family.
		Her brother, Candy, is a transvestite and an AIDS-sufferer who designs clothes.
		David, Mona's employer, a cerebral palsy-sufferer, is a proficient songwriter however, and composes a song which Mona steals and sends a demo of (with her own lyrics) into Melodifestivalen, the Swedish heats for the Eurovision contest.
		Much to Mona's delight, the song qualifies for the finals.
		Mona's new-found fame takes her to unexpected places, including a TV interview, and an invitation to lunch at Berns.
		Throughout, the film, though, Mona is torn as to whether she should reveal that she was not in fact the only writer of her song, and thus risk losing the public's support.

	Much as in The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan, where: 
		Potter declared the tale her next favorite to The Tailor of Gloucester.
		The pictures are some of the most beautiful Potter ever created, especially the profusions of flowers in the doorways and garden plots.
		The colors in the illustrations are not the muted browns and greens the reader expects in a Potter illustration, nor are they the contrasting colors such as the muted reds and blues Potter uses occasionally to give her illustrations a splash of color.
		Instead, the colors are bright oranges, violets, and yellows seldom seen in her other books.
		Even Ribby's lilac dress and Duchess's black mane illustrate Potter's concern for color in this book.
		Potter's own three-door oven, her hearthrug, her indoor plants, her coronation teapot, and her water pump are minutely detailed with more color than in other productions.
		The large format of the original edition, the captions accompanying the full page color illustrations, and the occasional lack of coordination between picture and text all display Potter's delight in the pictures, sometimes at the expense of the text.
		"Once upon a time", Ribby, a "Pussy-cat" invites a little dog called Duchess to tea with plans to serve her "something so very very nice" baked in a pie dish with a pink rim.
		Ribby promises Duchess she shall have the entree entirely to herself.
		Duchess accepts the invitation but hopes she will not be served mouse.
		"I really couldn't, couldn't eat mouse pie.
		And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party".
		Duchess has prepared a ham and veal pie in a pink-rimmed dish (just like Ribby's dish), and would much rather eat her own pie.
		"It is all ready to put into the oven," she says, "Such a lovely pie-crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust".
		She reads the invitation again and realizes she will have the opportunity to switch the pies when Ribby leaves on an errand.
		Ribby has two ovens, one above the other, and she puts her mouse pie in the lower oven.
		She tidies the house, sets the table, and leaves to buy tea, marmalade, and sugar.
		Duchess meantime has left home with her ham and veal pie in a basket, passes Ribby on the street, and hurries on to Ribby's house.
		She puts her pie into the upper oven, and searches quickly for the mouse pie (which she does not find because she neglects to look in the lower oven).
		She slips out the back door as Ribby returns.
		At the appointed hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's door and the party begins.
		Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie.
		Duchess eats greedily, believing she is eating her ham and veal pie.
		She wonders what has happened to the patty-pan she put in her pie, and, not finding it under the crust, is convinced she has swallowed it.
		She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find dr Maggoty, a magpie.
		Duchess is left alone before Ribby's fire, and discovers her ham and veal pie in the oven.
		"Then I must have been eating MOUSE.
		No wonder I feel ill," she muses.
		Knowing she cannot adequately explain her ham and veal pie to Ribby, she puts it outside the back door intending to sneak back and carry it home after she leaves for home.
		Ribby and dr Maggoty arrive and, after much fuss, Duchess takes her leave, only to find that the magpie (who has left by the back door) and a couple of jackdaws have eaten her ham and veal pie.
		Ribby later finds the remains of the pie dish and the patty-pan outside the back door and declares, "Well I never did.

		They try to fight him, to retrieve their money, but are defeated, so they ask him to train them, hoping to become the best fighters in the city.
		After surpassing the fighting skills of "ordinary people", Yipao soon discovers that Jia Wu Dao is a murderer.
		When he realises his secret has been revealed, Jia Wu Dao attempts to kill Yipao, but Taipao blocks the fatal blow and is killed in his place.
		Yipao escapes and plots how he will avenge his brother's death.
		He encounters a fat beggar (Sammo Hung) and, impressed by his kung fu, he asks the beggar to become his new kung fu master.
		After extensive training, the beggar asks Yipao to go and get him some wine.
		As he is about to return with the wine, Yipao encounters Jia Wu Dao again, and they fight, but Yipao's skill is insufficient.
		The fat beggar and Yipao then team up, using the monkey style kung fu, against Jia Wu Dao's snake style.

		Surya was a sales representative and worked with his friend Pichamuthu (Chinni Jayanth).
		His family, even knowing he played Kabaddi and often got into fights, was very kind with him.
		He saw one day, Rishaba (Uma), a college student, at the bus stop, who advised a smoker not to smoke because it distributed non-smokers and it would cause cancer to him.
		Surya was amazed by her words, so he dropped his cigarette and decided to stop smoking.
		Surya wakes up screaming and a container passenger (Manobala) jumps with fright.
		The container passenger is afraid of Surya and proposes him a little alcohol, Surya refuses and takes a cigarette.
		He goes back to his memories.
		Another day, his friend and he, bought black tickets from a boy at the cinema.
		Rishaba's friends also bought by this way, so Rishaba tore the tickets and said that bought tickets would encourage the boy to have a bad future.
		Surya tore the tickets in turn.
		Then, she accidentally dropped her book and Surya took it.
		The full night, Surya decrypted her personality by studying graphology.
		The next day, he brought the notebook to Rishaba with her personality description.
		She was surprised.
		Surya proposed his love and gave her a love letter.
		The following morning, he waited at the bus stop for her answer.
		She ignored him.
		He began to follow everywhere she went.
		Anxious, he called out her when she took the bus.
		He requested Rishaba to come tomorrow with the same clothes which she wore now (a blue Shalwar kameez) if she agreed his love or in another clothes if she disagreed his proposal, at the same place.
		The next day, she came with a red Shalwar kameez.
		Surya was vexed and he promised her that he never would cross his path again.
		Rishaba immediately showed him, her blue Shalwar kameez.
		She explains that her mother had put this dress on the washing machine, so she could not wear it wet.
		Finally, Rishaba said : "I love you" to Surya.
		Rishaba and Surya became much closed.
		Someday, at the river, Surya wrote on his hand Rishaba s name and his name, he showed to her.
		Rishaba found that to write separately their first name took away them.
		She surrounded the letter of each of their name : Soori.
		Surya jumped for joy and shouted : "It s not her name, It s not his name, It s their name".
		Back to the present, Surya takes his cigarette and burns his tattoo on his arm (which it is written Soori) with it, the eyes full of rage.
		Rishaba waited for Surya at the bus stop but he didn t arrive.
		Tomorrow, she gets mad against him, Surya apologized by saying that his bike was repair.
		She scolded him and was upset of the Surya s carelessness after only 15 days of love.
		She said : "Boys are very punctual and rigorous to charm girls who they love but when girls accept their love, they become careless about them".
		She explains him that lovers looked only for their plus points and after the marriage they looked only for their minus point which engaged later divorce.
		She didn t want that they separate because of this matter.
		She wished he shared his negative habits and she shared to him her bad habits to improve them to positive things.
		They are lovers for 25 days, Rishaba was afraid that time change people affections.
		Surya tries to appease but in vain.
		They decide to put their love to an endurance test to prove to themselves that the romance is much more than infatuation.
		The endurance test will last until the next valentine.
		Surya became less and less concentrated with what he did.
		Pichamuthu, after hearing a sad story of a man, phoned to Rishaba to tell her that Surya was admitted at the hospital in a serious condition.
		She went at the hospital upset and she didn t find him.
		She phoned to Surya and he answered, she hung up without talking.

		One day, Surya thinks he sees Rishaba and runs behind an auto rickshaw.
		At the same moment, Manikandan is in a photo shop and punishes the seller to scratch Rishaba s frame photo.

		Surya doesn t even see the photo.

		She asks why he does that, he replies that he searches his girlfriend everywhere where the women are presents.
		Surya gives to Devi Rishaba s photo.
		Regrettably, Devi doesn t see the photo and put it at Manikandan s pocket.
		The housemaid gives the shirt to a Dhobi.
		The dhobi finds Priya s photo and gives it to Devi.
		She recognizes the cover given by Surya.

	Much as in The Pandora Directive, where: 
		Like all Tex Murphy games, The Pandora Directive takes place in post-World War III San Francisco in April 2043.
		After the devastating events of WWIII, many major cities have been rebuilt (as is the case with New San Francisco), though certain areas still remain as they were before the war (as in Old San Francisco).
		WWIII also left another mark on the world: the formation of two classes of citizens.
		Specifically, the Mutants and the Norms.
		After the events of Under a Killing Moon, tensions between the two groups have begun to diminish.
		The end to the Crusade for Genetic Purity was a turning point in the relations between Mutants and "Norms".
		Tex still lives on Chandler Ave, which recently underwent a city-funded cleanup.
		The events of WWIII still left the planet with no ozone layer, and to protect their citizens many countries adopted a time reversal.
		Instead of sleeping at night, and being awake in the day, humans have become nocturnal, in a manner of speaking.
		Though Tex lives in what is considered a Mutant area of town, he himself is a "Norm".
		In The Pandora Directive, after accidentally offending his love interest Chelsee Bando, Tex (Chris Jones) is hired by Gordon Fitzpatrick (Kevin McCarthy) to find his friend, Thomas Malloy (John Agar).
		He learns that Malloy stayed at the Ritz, and decides to follow up the lead after reconciling with Chelsee and agreeing to go for dinner with her at her apartment.
		Upon investigating Malloy's room, Tex is knocked out by a mysterious masked figure dressed in black.
		Tex is out through the night, inadvertently missing his date with Chelsee.
		After finding out that a female acquaintance of Malloy works at the Fuchsia Flamingo club, Tex offers to take Chelsee there to both apologise and hopefully to check out the lead.
		Regardless of whether Chelsee comes out with Tex or not, she will decide to take a vacation to Phoenix for a few days.
		At the club, Tex meets with the girl, Emily who agrees to trade information on Malloy if Tex can find out who is stalking her.
		She gives a note she received from her stalker to Tex and upon showing it to his connection in the police station Mac Malden, Tex finds out that Emily is being observed by the Black Arrow Killer.
		Tex is able to discover that the NSA is involved and looking for Malloy, and breaks into one of their headquarters, Autotech.
		He finds out that the NSA are using video surveillance to monitor the goings on in Emily's room at the Fuchsia Flamingo.
		Tex finds the source of this and sees a figure dresses similarly to the person who attacked him in Mallory's room waiting to confront Emily.
		Tex hurries over to the club and is able to get there just in time to see the Killer jump out of the window carrying a small box.
		(Whether Emily survives or not will depend on the storyline path) Tex chases him down and in the ensuing fight accidentally causes the Killer to fall off the roof and die.
		Tex removes the Killer's mask and sees that it is NSA agent Dag Horton, who had an office in Autotech.
		Tex is pulled in for questioning by the police, but is allowed to leave when an unknown woman enters the station and speaks to Mac.
		Tex retrieves the box that Horton stole from Emily's room, but is seized by the NSA and taken to Jackson Cross's office at Autotech.
		He is threatened to stay out of their affairs, and is forced to hand over the box.
		Returning to his office, Tex is met by the woman who talked the police into letting him go.
		She reveals her name is Regan Madsen, she is Thomas Malloy's daughter and that Malloy sent out several boxes like the one Tex found.
		Tex goes to the Fuchsia Flamingo and finds out that Emily is Malloy's wife, hence her being sent a box.
		using the return address on the packaging, Tex is finally able to track down Malloy in a run down warehouse in the industrial district.
		After establishing that Tex is not with the NSA, he reveals that he used to work at Roswell, the military base where a spacecraft allegedly crashed in 1947.
		Malloy asserts that the crash was legitimate and that the government covered the story up.
		The military began investigating then wreckage to look for weapons, and in the 1980s Malloy came in to the project to attempt to decipher the hieroglyphics on the craft.
		After World War 3, Malloy left the project but was able to continue his research in secret.
		Before Malloy can continue his story, two NSA agents arrive and kill him.
		Tex is able to escape by blowing the building up.
		Tex fills a disheartened Fitzpatrick in on the events, but insists on following up on the details he has uncovered.
		Fitzpatrick tells him that he worked with Malloy in Roswell, and that after becoming close friends, Malloy confided in him that he had been deciphering the alien hieroglyphics and had discovered that a second spacecraft had crashed somewhere on Earth.
		He then reveals that he received one of Malloy's boxes and there are probably about 6 in circulation.
		Tex meets with Regan to tell her about her father, and she agrees to give him her box despite reservations that Tex will open it and sell off the information for himself.
		After stealing Horton's personal effects from the morgue where his body is being held, Tex is able to get into Autotech's evidence room to recover Emily's box.
		Tex travels to the Cosmic Connection shop and speaks to Archie Ellis, an eccentric comic book nerd and ufologist who recently interviewed Malloy.
		Archie tells him that the famous author Elijah Witt set up the interview between them, during which Malloy made several cryptic references to something called 'The Pandora Device'.
		He also reveals that during their research into the alien crafts at Roswell, the scientists accidentally released something into the facility that proceeded to kill off practically everyone in the complex before the military moved in and quarantined the entire base.
		Archie tells Tex that Malloy sent him one of the boxes but it was stolen, and that the alien power cell in a picture from one of the other boxes is still stored in the Roswell complex.
		Tex travels to Roswell and enters the deserted site, but whilst moving around the facility becomes increasingly aware that he is being stalked.
		It is revealed that the alien entity released by the researchers many years before is still lurking in the complex, but Tex is able to seal it off in a containment pod before he suffers that same fate and is then able to secure the power cell from the security room.
		Tex is able to break the code on a disc Malloy sent to Elijah Witt on which Malloy reveals that each of the boxes sent out contains a piece of the Pandora Device and that assembling the parts will reveal the information Malloy had discovered.
		After obtaining all the relevant pieces, Tex summons Fitzpatrick, Regan and Witt to his office where he assembles the Pandora Device.
		A hologram of Malloy appears and tells the group that there was indeed another spacecraft that landed on Earth and that Malloy discovered its location.
		He hypothesises that the ship contains large amounts of anti-hydrogen on board, and that if this gets into the wrong hands it could result in the destruction of life on Earth.
		Witt immediately decides that the ship must be destroyed, but Regan is adamant that they could sell the technology off for big money.
		Regardless, the four decide that they must find the craft so they each take a separate route to the location Malloy specified.
		Tex arrives and manages to navigate his way through a dense jungle and an ancient Mayan labyrinth in which he comes across Regan who set off earlier in hope she might get there first.
		Tex and Regan find the ship, but Jackson Cross arrives and it revealed that Regan and Cross had been working together all along.
		Before Cross is able to kill Tex, Fitzpatrick emerges from the ship and invites the three on board.
		Fitzpatrick shows them around and offers to show them the central power core before locking Regan and Cross inside, but not before Cross fires his gun and hits Fitzpatrick.
		As he is dying, Fitzpatrick reveals that he knows how to work the controls of the ship as his father was one of the aliens from the ship; his mother was a human woman from Nebraska, hence Fitzpatrick's human appearance.
		After urging Tex to type in the correct controls, he dies from his wound and Tex quickly exits the ship just in time for it to ascend into space and self-destruct.
		Tex is picked up by a late arriving Elijah Witt and taken home.
		From this point several endings are possible depending on how you choose to make Tex behave throughout the game:  Mission Street:  1.
		Chelsee returns from Phoenix and invites Tex round for dinner, during which he recounts his tale though she remains skeptical.
		Afterwards she reveals she is dressed in a square dance outfit and rewards Tex with a striptease.
		2.
		Chelsee and Tex go for a drink at the Brew 'n' Stew.
		Chelsee reveals that she feels she isn't ready to commit to a relationship so and Tex should just remain good friends.
		Having signed up to the new 'holodate' service, a hologram of Clark Gable arrives to take Chelsee on a date.
		A deflated Tex returns to his office and calls the holodate service himself.
		He speaks to the manager (a hologram of Humphrey Bogart) and requests a two for one special date with Jayne Mansfield and Anna Nicole Smith.
		Lombard Street:  1.
		Same as Mission Street Ending 2.
		2.
		On the space craft when Cross shoots he hits Tex instead of Fitzpatrick.
		He is able to limp off the ship and sees it explode.
		Having ruined his chances with Chelsee he decides to give up his career as aI.
		and join the circus as a clown.
		We see him backstage putting on his makeup before going on, glancing briefly at photograph of Chelsee before sadly leaving the room to perform.
		Boulevard of Broken Dreams:  1.
		Same as Lombard Street Ending 2  2.
		On the space craft Tex is shot in the leg, but is unable to get off before itself destructs and dies.
		3.
		Before boarding the ship, Cross will give his gun to Tex and ask him to shoot Fitzpatrick.
		If the player opts to shoot Cross instead, the gun will be empty and Cross will pull out a loaded gun and shoot Tex dead.
		4.
		If the player chooses to shoot Fitzpatrick, the gun will be empty.
		Before Cross can shoot Fitzpatrick himself, Tex suggests they go to look on the ship.
		Fitzpatrick will lock all three of them in the ship's core.

		Sick of his parents rejecting potential wives when they don't feel a pea under one hundred mattresses, he slips his bowling ball under her mattresses when his parents have her over.
		In "The Other Frog Prince", the princess kisses the frog: he says "I was just kidding," and hops back in the lake.
		"The Really Ugly Duckling" (a parody of Hans Christian Andersen's The Ugly Duckling), grows up to be a Really Ugly Duck, rather than a swan.
		"Cinderumplestiltskin" combines Cinderella and Rumplestiltskin.

	Much as in Home Made Mince Pie, where: 
		Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24, 1910.
		It states: "Life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome, and were it not for the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given, existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed.
		So the time honored get-togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay.
		The Gales thought well of this established feature.
		They made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests.
		They were hardly an overly wealthy family, and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life, but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time".
		"On the night before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests' comfort.
		At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape.
		So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie.
		First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise.
		Then arrived the guests.
		The Minister and the mrs Minister, they were, and some neighbors.
		While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring.
		Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen.
		She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests.
		Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored.
		He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince.
		No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey.

		In 1594 Archer became involved in controversy, when it was alleged that he had plotted two years previously with other Jesuits and Stanley to assassinate Queen Elizabeth The chosen assassin had been Hugh Cahill, a Tipperary man, who confessed that he was paid to hang about the court at London, on the off chance that the queen might present herself as a target, and then stab her.
		The confession had been obtained under torture by Richard Topcliffe, and further information came from an agent of Robert Cecil, secretary to the queen.
		At this time, Archer was also implicated in a plot to torch the French and English ships at Dieppe.
		The merits of the allegations are impossible to judge, although it seems clear that Archer was acquainted with Cahill.
		The assassination plot was just one of many against the queen that received credence during the final decade of her reign.
		One sceptic has pointed out that the evidence only emerged once Father Robert Persons had published his A Conference about the Next Succession to the Crown of England.

		Brothers Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and Danny (Jonah Bobo) can never seem to get along with each other, or with their older teen-aged sister, Lisa (Kristen Stewart).
		While staying at their divorced father's home while he is away at work and Lisa is asleep, the boys discover an old clockwork-driven space-themed board game called "Zathura" in the basement.
		The two begin to play the game, the goal to be the first to reach the final space named Zathura.
		During each turn, the game provides a card with instructions, but the two quickly realize the cards affect reality, starting with a meteor shower.
		They soon discover the house is floating on a small rock alongside Saturn.
		Meanwhile, Lisa looks out the window, and believing it is merely dark, goes to shower for her date.
		When the boys try to warn Lisa about what has happened, they find she is frozen in cryonic sleep as a result of one of the cards.
		The brothers realize that the only way to end the game and hopefully return to Earth is to reach the end space of Zathura.
		As they continue to play, Walter and Danny avoid the dangers that the game's cards throw at them like a defective robot (Frank Oz) and the house coming under attack by a race of reptilian aliens called Zorgons.
		Another card brings aboard a stranded astronaut (Dax Shepard) who goes about eliminating the house's heat sources (during which Walter turns down the house's heating thermostat) and setting a couch on fire and pushing it outside into space to lure the Zorgons' ship away with its heat signature (since Zorgons are attracted to heat).
		As the brothers' tension rises, Walter accuses Danny of cheating by moving a piece prematurely, but when Walter tries to correct it, the game reacts as if Walter was cheating and ejects him out of the house into the vacuum of space, but the Astronaut rescues him.
		On Walter's next turn, he receives a card that allows him to make a wish, and considers making a wish to make Danny go away.

		The farmer, ashamed of them, kept the twins locked in their room.
		Eventually the twins got sick from a liver disease and died together, so the farmer sawed them in half and buried the good twin in a cemetery and the bad twin in a shallow grave near the house, at the end of an old dirt road called Cry Baby Lane, as whoever is caught out there at night will hear the cries of the deceased twin.
		Later, Andrew, Carl, and a group of friends decide to hold a s ance in the cemetery where the good twin is buried, but soon after the seance, a creepy phenomenon occurs around the town.

	Much as in We Were There (manga), where: 
		Nanami Takahashi, a teenage girl in her first year of high school, hopes to make new friends quickly.
		The center of attention at her school is Motoharu Yano, a very popular boy, whom Nanami dislikes at the beginning, due to his apparent superficiality.
		However, she soon falls in love with him, but Yano is still affected by the loss of his girlfriend, Nana Yamamoto.
		Nana was killed in a car crash a year before the beginning of the story.
		Because she was with her ex-boyfriend at the time of her death, Yano suspects she was cheating on him.
		Due to this, he is unable to trust people or to talk about his relationship with her; instead, he chooses to pretend he does not care very much about the situation.
		Nanami confesses her love to Yano, but is rejected when he is unable to tell her if he loves her back.
		Despite that, she is still willing to support him and reassures him she will always be by his side.
		Soon, Yano realizes he has fallen in love with her as well, so they start going out.
		However, Yano's secrets (including the fact that he slept with Nana's little sister, Yuri, after the accident and his unwillingness to talk about his feelings for his dead girlfriend) make Nanami unsure to the point that she decides to end the relationship, believing she is unable to make him happy.
		The story becomes even more complicated when Masafumi Takeuchi, Yano's best friend, also falls in love with Nanami and becomes Yano's rival.
		Due to these circumstances, Nanami is confused over whom she should choose, but she soon realizes that Yano is the one she genuinely loves.
		She agrees to start going out with him again, on the condition that she can find out more about the relationship between Nana and Yano and his true feelings about what had happened.
		Their romance takes an unexpected turn when Yano finds out that his mother, Yoko, wants to move to Tokyo.
		Upon hearing this, Nanami tells him to make a decision without taking her into consideration.
		The anime ends with Yano's departure; however, the two of them decide to continue their relationship.
		The manga picks up four years later.
		It is revealed that Yano and Nanami kept in touch for about six months, then he stopped contacting her and disappeared without a trace.
		Tired of waiting, hurt and confused, Nanami starts a relationship with Takeuchi.
		Even so, she is still in love with Yano and unable to forget about their common past.
		She befriends a co-worker named Akiko Sengenji, who is revealed to be one of Yano's classmates from the Tokyo high school he transferred to.
		In a series of flashbacks it is shown that Yano was forced to work part-time when his mother was diagnosed with cancer, but kept everything hidden from Nanami, not wanting to worry her.
		Following an unexpected visit from Michiko, her former friend and wife of Yano's father, Yoko became increasingly paranoid, fearing he would leave her.
		When Yano announced his decision to go and visit Nanami, she accused him of being insensitive.
		After a short, but violent fight, Yoko hung herself; as in Nana's case, Yano blamed himself for her death and therefore decided to sever all the ties with his past.
		Sengenji is also in love with Yano, but, despite this, she sees Nanami as a friend, not as a rival.
		She is the one who reveals Yano's whereabouts to Nanami (including the fact that he adopted his father's name, Nagakura) and later the fact that he lives with Yuri Yamamoto.
		As a result, Nanami rejects Takeuchi when he proposes to her, feeling that it wouldn't be fair to marry him.
		Upon meeting Nanami for the first time in more than five years, Yano claims he is in love with another woman.
		However, when he and Nanami meet again, she tells him that she knows about the relationship between him and Yuri.
		He then admits that he only stays with Yuri because her mother is dying and he feels he can't leave her alone.
		He also tells Nanami about his mother's suicide, and also about his panic attacks.
		During this meeting, it is hinted that he's still in love with her.
		Meanwhile, Takeuchi decides to continue his relationship with Nanami, but only as friends.
		He tells her that she will eventually reach Yano and asks her to wait for him.
		He also starts to push Yano to admit his own feelings for Nanami and points out that no matter how strong she seems, she is unable to deal with the situation by herself.
		Nanami and Yano have an unexpected meeting, during which Yano finally confesses he wanted her to hold him back instead of letting him leave with his mother.
		Shortly after, Yuri's mother dies, which prompts Yuri to end her relationship with Yano.
		She reveals to him that her sister Nana never cheated on him and that she only wanted to have a proper break-up with her ex-boyfriend at the time of the accident.
		Yano decides to start over with Nanami and tries to contact her on the telephone.
		He fails several times due to her busy schedule, but eventually reaches her.
		During their conversation, a severely over-worked and anaemic Nanami falls down from a flight of stairs and is brought to the hospital injured and unconscious.
		Terrified by the possibility of losing her as well, Yano rushes to her side - as a result, the two of them are reunited.
		The finale of the manga shows Yano proposing to Nanami and then visiting Yamamoto Nana's grave site with her.

	Much as in George Wickham, where: 
		Once he appears at Meryton, Wickham is noticed, especially by the Bennet sisters: his youth, his manly beauty, his distinguished look and bearing speak immediately in favour of this handsome stranger seen in the street.
		He has all the appearance of the ideal romantic hero.
		The uniform, the red coat of Colonel Forster's militia, adds to his prestige among the women.
		Once he is introduced by Lieutenant Denny, the friend he accompanied, he displays friendly manners and "a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming".
		Susan Morgan notes that in contrast to Austen's introductions of other characters, Wickham's introduction "tells us nothing of mr Wickham's qualities or nature, but only of his looks and manners".
		Elizabeth Bennet, in particular, is "delighted": she finds him well above the captains of the militia in elegance and manners.
		That is why, when her aunt, Mrs Philips, invited some officers and her nieces to her home the following evening, she is flattered to be "the happy woman" with whom Wickham spends most of the first evening.
		He seems to her much more worthy of interest when he appears to be an innocent victim of the cruelty and jealousy of mr Darcy, whom she finds so unpleasant.
		As the narrator reveals nothing of the new officer's past, he is seen exclusively through the positive image that Elizabeth and other characters form of Wickham&nbsp;  in particular mrs Gardiner, her aunt.
		A native of Derbyshire, where she had lived "ten or twelve years before her marriage", he gave her the opportunity to evoke pleasant memories of youth, so she was inclined towards him.
		And if she puts Elizabeth on guard when she sees the interest her niece has in him, it is not that she does not trust him, but, as he has no money, it would be very "imprudent" on the part of her niece to fall in love and marry him.
		According to David Shapard, the only reason why Wickham and Elizabeth do not seriously consider marriage is that they are both without funds.
		The Bennets, who were offended by the snobbery of Darcy and of Bingley's sisters, welcome him and listen to the story of his grievances with sympathy and without mistrust.
		mr Bennet himself has a certain weakness for him.
		Jennifer Preston Wilson asserts that Wickham relies upon making a very good first impression and carefully reading his audience to find out their sympathies.
		The first appearance of Wickham in Meryton is when Darcy and Elizabeth meet again after their first encounter at the ball.
		The scene takes place in the street where the Bennet ladies, accompanied by the ridiculous and pompous mr Collins, come to make the acquaintance of Wickham, when they are joined by Darcy and Bingley who are just crossing the city on horseback.
		Only Elizabeth, burning to know the explanation, notices the brief exchange between Wickham and Darcy: one turned red, the other pale.
		As all the focus is on Elizabeth noticing this exchange between the men, Burns suggests that we are not told that Wickham is observing Darcy and Elizabeth as well.
		Wickham profits from the sympathy enjoyed in the city by Colonel Forster and his regiment choosing Meryton as its winter quarters.
		It is one of the local militias raised to reinforce the army against the threat of French invasion.
		The presence of officers, generally young people from good families, disrupts the routine of local social life: they participate in community life, inviting gentlemen to the mess, and being invited themselves to balls, evening socials, and receptions.
		As some came with their spouses, teas and visits between women increased the occasions for marriageable young ladies to meet these dashing idle officers in red coats.
		England was at war, the population feared an invasion, the army was recruiting and the prestige of the regimental uniform was therefore total.
		It was possible for a new militia officer to make a fresh start in life, as Wickham's rank could be obtained without having to live in the local area.
		In addition, according to the Cambridge Chronicle of 3 January 1795, the Derbyshire Militia, which Deidre Le Faye suggests inspired Jane Austen, was very well behaved in the two towns of Hertfordshire where it was stationed, as well as in church.
		Only mr Bingley and his sisters, mr Darcy's friends, consider he is not respectable and he behaved in an undignified way towards the latter, but they ignore the details of the story.
		They only know that Darcy "cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned".
		In any case, they quickly leave Hertfordshire, leaving the field free to Wickham.
		Burning to know the reasons for his and Darcy's attitude when they were face to face, and blinded by her prejudice against Darcy, Elizabeth is not alerted by the impropriety that Wickham demonstrated by using the first opportunity to address the subject himself; she does not realize the skill with which he manipulates her through his hesitation and reticence.
		On the contrary she looks forward to his sparkling conversation, not realising her imprudence in believing a man who is a tricky conversationalist.
		Relying totally on his good looks, she accepts without question, without even considering to check it, his version of the story.
		She sympathises fully with his misfortunes, when he obligingly describes the unfair treatment to which he was subjected: Darcy had, through pure jealousy, refused to respect the will of his late father who had promised him the enjoyment of ecclesiastical property belonging to the family, forcing him to enlist in the militia to live.
		Although Wickham states that out of respect to his godfather, he cannot denounce Darcy, he does so, feeding into Elizabeth's prejudices about Darcy.
		He lies with skill, especially by omission, taking care not to mention his own faults, and remains close enough to the truth to deceive Elizabeth: nothing he says about the behaviour of Darcy is fundamentally wrong, but it is a warped presentation, "pure verbal invention" according to Tony Tanner.
		Darcy's generosity, attention to his farmers, and affection for his sister, are presented as the work of a calculating mind with a terrible aristocratic pride.
		Thus, in the context of Meryton, without his past and his family being known, Wickham's lies are readily believed, and he is left to indulge in his weakness for gambling and debauchery.
		He is protected by the mask of his fine manners and the certainty that Darcy, anxious to preserve the reputation of his younger sister, would not stoop to denounce him.
		In the long letter that Darcy presents to her in Rosings Park Elizabeth discovers the true past of Wickham and can begin to sort out the truth from the lies.
		She thus recognises that she failed in judgment, "because his attitude, his voice, his manners had established him straightaway as in possession of all qualities".
		She admits to being at first mistaken by the appearance of righteousness and an air of distinction.
		She notices an "affectation" and an "idle and frivolous gallantry" in Wickham's manners after being informed by Darcy's letter.
		George Wickham was the son of an estate manager for mr Darcy Senior, and George Wickham was the godson of mr Darcy Senior, who raised him practically like a second son, both in recognition of his father's work and loyalty and by affection for this boy with "charming manners".
		Because he wanted to secure Wickham's future, his godfather paid for his studies in college and then at Cambridge.
		By giving him the ability to enter religious orders and by granting him the living of a Curacy dependent on Pemberley (Kympton), he would have guaranteed Wickham a most honourable social position.
		Not at all attracted by the clerical profession, to the great relief of Darcy, Wickham preferred to claim a final settlement of  3,000 at the death of his godfather.
		Once this money was squandered Darcy refused him further help, so Darcy supposed that he sought revenge by taking advantage of Georgiana Darcy's stay in Ramsgate to seduce her, hoping to steal her away and marry her, getting his hands on the young girl's  30,000 dowry.
		His attempt to seduce Georgiana was facilitated by their childhood friendship (to which Darcy alluded when he described Wickham to Elizabeth) and the relative isolation of the shy adolescent (she was only fifteen years old) without a mother to chaperone her at the seaside town.
		He is a good-for-nothing and a scoundrel who shows two forms of evil.
		He is "imprudent and extravagant" as Colonel Forster finally discovered, which meant, in less diplomatic language, that he had love affairs and piled up debts, especially gambling debts.
		It is discovered at the time of his elopement with Lydia that Wickham has not maintained any long friendships before he entered the militia at the urging of Denny.
		This is presented in the novel as having been a sign of his bad character, and Fulford states that Wickham uses the prestige of the militia and the anonymity it provides to run away from his debts.
		He searched desperately for a financially advantageous marriage: in Meryton, Wickham openly courted Mary King from the moment she inherited 10,000 pounds, but her uncle took her to Liverpool.
		Tongues loosened to reveal other misadventures once Lydia's absence became known: "He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family".
		Lydia, at fifteen, Georgiana's age when he tried to take her away, falls madly in love while they are in Brighton, to the point of agreeing to accompany him when he flees the regiment for not paying his debts of honour.
		She refuses to leave him, insensitive to the collateral damage the scandal will cause to her family, but he only marries her in desperation, negotiating the terms with Darcy who uses his connections and his fortune to procure Wickham a position, and save Lydia's respectability, allying himself with Mr Gardiner for the occasion.
		The reactions of the Bennet family are mixed: Mrs Bennet, relieved to see a first daughter duly married, and delighted that it is her favourite daughter, welcomes the young couple with affection after the wedding, sorry to see them go to rejoin the Garrison at Newcastle.
		Jane blushed in confusion and Mr Bennet ironically claims to be "enormously proud" of a son-in-law so shameless and cynical: "He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all".
		Elizabeth is "disgusted" to see Lydia and him so comfortable and "promises, in the future, never to set limits on the impudence of an impudent man".
		According to Claire Tomalin, this is partially due to a lingering jealousy of Elizabeth towards Lydia for marrying Wickham.
		Wickham's final scene in the novel is "presented as an interruption" - Woloch notes that Elizabeth tries to walk to the house quickly in order to get rid of him, and that she "hoped she had silenced him".
		According to Woloch, the narrator suggests that Wickham and Elizabeth "never speak seriously again" after this conversation.
		In this conversation, Wickham tries to discern what Elizabeth now knows about him with some "careful probing", and she responds with "some gentle teasing", which Mai interprets as showing the value of forgiveness.
		Elizabeth is no longer fooled, not by his beautiful rhetoric nor by his engaging ways.
		Elizabeth and Jane, who are the only ones to know the whole truth of Wickham's character, continue their financial support of their sister, and Darcy helps Wickham in his career (as he had promised his father, and for the sake of his wife), but the doors of Pemberley remain definitely closed to him.

	Much as in Johnny Gaddaar, where: 
		The film starts out on a rainy night with a conversation between four cops in a police van, patrolling the streets of Mumbai.
		A car narrowly misses colliding into them on the road, brakes and then continues on towards a house with iron gates.
		A man in a jacket gets out from the car, heads towards the garage and opens the roller shutter door when he is shot from behind multiple times.
		In the same time the cops in the van receive an alert on the radio that gunshots have been heard somewhere in the vicinity and they ask the driver to head towards the location of the gunshots.
		The entire movie is then shown as a flashback, building up to the present shooting, and scene of the cops in the van.
		The story is about a gang of five that run a gambling club and conduct other underhand deals.
		The five members are Vikram (Neil Nitin Mukesh), Seshadri (Dharmendra), Shardul (Zakir Hussain), Prakash (Vinay Pathak) and Shiva (Dayanand Shetty).
		When one of Seshadri's police contacts from Bengaluru, Kalyan (Govind Namdeo) informs him, on the phone about "French furniture" (code word for drugs) worth Rs.
		5&nbsp;crore that he can offer him for Rs.
		25&nbsp;crore, Seshadri calls for all 5 members to contribute Rs.
		50&nbsp;lacs each to set the deal in motion.
		Based on Shardul's promise of being able to sell the furniture for more than Rs.
		5&nbsp;crore, each member anticipates a profit of a further Rs.
		50&nbsp;lacs each, at least.
		They agree that Shiva is to take the money to Bengaluru by train, meet Kalyan, make the exchange and return on the same train.
		Vikram, who is dating Shardul's wife Mini (Rimi Sen) and desperately wants to emigrate to Canada with her, plans to steal the money from Shiva in the train by using chloroform to make him unconscious.
		In the pretext of going to Goa for business work, he goes about his plot, driving to Pune (where he uses the name Johnny G to check-in to hotel) then takes a flight to Goa.
		In Goa, he meets advocate Gomes (Raj Tilak) who is Seshadri's friend, to get his work done and to serve as an alibi later, if required.
		He makes sure the work is half done, flies back to Mumbai and checks-in to a hotel before boarding the train that Shiva takes, the train to Bengaluru enroute Pune.
		But plans go wrong and Vikram ends up killing Shiva who unmasks him before going unconscious.
		Now Sheshadri, Kalyan, Prakash and Shardul one-by-one, find out Vikram's truth and are killed by him in cold blood.
		Finally, Vikram is killed by Prakash's wife, Varsha (Ashwini Kalsekar) who mistakes him for Shardul, who she believed was Prakash's killer.

		They put up with it for a while but things become intolerable.
		One day a party of four policemen arrive to confiscate his firearms.
		This causes a flashpoint for him - he loves his guns and is not going to hand them over.
		He shoots all the cops and, in the ensuing altercations, three more locals before heading to the hills.

		Jud Elliott II is a failed Harvard history masters student in 2059.
		Bored with his job as a law clerk, he takes up a position with the Time Service as a Time Courier.
		After an introductory course, Jud shunts up and down the time line ("up the line" is travel into the past; "down the line" is forward time travel, but only to "now-time," Jud's present of 2059) as a guide for tourists visiting ancient and medieval Byzantium/Constantinople.
		Jud's problems include not only stupid tourists, but also greedy and mentally unstable colleagues who attempt to cause various types of havoc with the past.
		He is forced to break the rules in order to patch things up without drawing the attention of the Time Patrol.
		When he meets and falls in love with the 'marvelous transtemporal paradox called Pulcheria' - his own multi-great grandmother - Jud succumbs to the lure of the past, creates irreparable paradoxes, and faces the inescapable clutches of the Time Patrol.
		Silverberg's narrative includes some cleverly worked out details about the problems of time-travel tourism.
		For example, the number of tourists who over the years wish to witness the Sermon on the Mount has increased the audience at the event from the likely dozens to hundreds and even thousands.
		Time-tour guides re-visiting the same event must also take care not to scan their surroundings too closely, lest they make eye contact with themselves leading another tour party.
		Silverberg's interest in the Byzantine era of Roman history is put to use with a vivid description of Constantinople during the reign of Justinian, and the Nika riots of 532.

	Much as in The Great Patty Caper, where: 
		At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob goes into the freezer to get Krabby Patties, only to discover that none are left.
		He and mr Krabs try to make more, but cannot decide on the recipe.
		mr Krabs gives SpongeBob the key to the vault in which the recipe is hidden, and he and Patrick board a train to the bank for the safe deposit box.
		Eventually, the key to the box is stolen and SpongeBob and Patrick must find the culprit.
		Just then, Plankton walks up and Patrick searches him, but finds him clean.
		The duo stops the train to find the suspect responsible for stealing the key.
		A nanny and her baby are searched, only to find a stolen jewel that was stolen by triplets.
		The next suspect, a butler, is revealed to be a thief named Orin Ruffy who stole $75,000 worth of ham sandwiches.
		SpongeBob cries hopelessly but soon finds Patrick having the key; in fact, he finds it while he cleans SpongeBob's pants.
		They go back into the train and are on their way to the bank.
		Eventually, Plankton bats them out of a window and they must chase the train.
		It is revealed that Plankton has the key.
		SpongeBob morphs himself into a hang glider and he and Patrick fly back onto the train to pursue him.
		Once they return, SpongeBob and Patrick chase Plankton.
		But, Plankton disconnects the cars of the train, leaving SpongeBob and Patrick in the front car.
		SpongeBob and Patrick try to stop the train but Patrick stupidly breaks the brake of the train causing the train to go out of control.
		He makes several (but stupid) futile attempts to stop the train, including putting a heavy boulder on the tracks.
		This only causes the train to flip and move forward while some of the wheels are off the track.
		The two manage to bring all wheels back in place when they stop in front of a retirement home.
		Then, Patrick stupidly breaks the throttle.
		Meanwhile, Plankton is seen trying to steal the formula by mr Krabs.
		However, he still escapes with it, but the train come into the bank and stops Plankton before he could leave.

Daffy
	Much as in Girl, Interrupted, where: 
		The plot of Girl, Interrupted does not follow a linear storyline, but instead the author provides personal stories through a series of short descriptions of events and personal reflections on why she was placed in the hospital.
		She begins by talking about the concept of a parallel universe and how easy it is to slip into one, comparing insanity to an alternate world.
		She discusses how some people fall into insanity gradually and others just snap.
		Kaysen also details the doctor's visit before first going to the hospital and the taxi ride there at the beginning of the book before launching into the chronicles of her time at the hospital.
		The hospital also sits upon a hill, and it's a big brick building.
		In April 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is admitted to McLean Hospital, in Belmont, Massachusetts, after attempting suicide by overdosing on pills.
		She denies that it was a suicide attempt to a psychiatrist, who suggests she take time to regroup in McLean, a private mental hospital.
		Susanna is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and her stay extends to 18 months rather than the proposed couple of weeks.
		Fellow patients Polly, Cynthia, Lisa Rowe, Lisa Cody, Georgina, and Daisy contribute to Susanna s experiences at McLean as she describes their personal issues and how they come to cope with the time they must spend in the hospital.
		Susanna also introduces the reader to particular staff members, including Valerie, dr Wick and mrs McWeeney.
		Susanna and the other girls are eventually informed that the recently released Daisy committed suicide on her birthday.
		Daisy's death deeply saddens the girls and they hold a prolonged moment of silence in her memory.
		Susanna reflects on the nature of her illness, including difficulty making sense of visual patterns, and suggests that sanity is a falsehood constructed to help the "healthy" feel "normal" in comparison.
		She also questions how doctors treat mental illness, and whether they are treating the brain or the mind.
		During her stay in the ward, Susanna also undergoes a period of depersonalization, where she bites open the flesh on her hand after she becomes terrified that she has "lost her bones".
		She develops a frantic obsession with the verification of this proposed reality and even insists on seeing an X-ray of herself to make sure.
		This hectic moment is described with shorter, choppy sentences that show Kaysen's state of mind and thought processes as she went through them.
		Also, during a trip to the dentist with Valerie, Susanna becomes frantic after she wakes from the general anesthesia, when no one will tell her how long she was unconscious, and she fears that she has lost time.
		Like the incident with her bones, Kaysen here also rapidly spirals into a panicky and obsessive state that is only ultimately calmed with medication.
		After leaving McLean, Susanna mentions that she kept in touch with Georgina and eventually saw Lisa, now a single mother who was about to board the subway with her adolescent son and seemed, although quirky, to be sane.

	Much as in Bloodfang, where: 
		The first series (12 episodes, 38 pages) begins with Bloodfang hatching from his egg, 100 million years ago.
		He promptly kills his siblings, and is raised by his mother, Karka, until she is killed in a fight with the tyrannosaur pack leader, Blackheart, who happens to be Bloodfang's father.
		During the fight Bloodfang is wounded in the face by Blackheart, leaving him with permanent scars.
		Bloodfang flees, and becomes an outcast from the pack.
		Forced to fend for himself, the young tyrannosaur initially struggles to survive, and nearly starves.
		His first meal without his mother's assistance consists of carrion.
		However when other dinosaurs (four sauroctoni) try to steal his meal from him, he cunningly bides his time until they have gorged themselves, and then attacks them when, sleepy and bloated, they are vulnerable, killing two and driving the others away.
		Over the next four years he grows to become six metres tall and weigh ten tonnes, by which time he has learned to be a ferocious fighter, stronger than most adults of his species.
		Bloodfang returns to his pack during mating season, and kills a rival male tyrannosaur to steal his harem of females.
		Bloodfang quickly establishes his status as one of the strongest of the pack, but backs down when challenged by Blackheart, who is still the leader.
		Eventually, during a final reckoning, Bloodfang kills Blackheart and usurps him as leader of the pack, while the rest of the pack feast on Blackheart's corpse.
		In the second series (30 episodes) time-travellers from 2150, hunting dinosaurs for meat with which to feed the people of the 22nd century, attack Bloodfang's pack.
		Bloodfang fights back, but is eventually captured, brought to 2150 and kept in a zoo.
		Escaping, he goes on a rampage, killing many humans, until he returns to his own time.

		The first series consisted of twenty-six episodes.
		It starred Adam Saunders as Heath, the relaxed joker who struggles with school; Tahyna Tozzi as Perri, resident glamour queen from the Gold Coast; Sophie Luck as Fly, the youngest; Kate Bell as Bec, the local; Khan Chittenden as Edge, the aggressive and competitive teenager; Chris Foy as Matt, the generic 'smart guy' and Mara Scherzinger as Anna, a famous German Kiteboarder.
		At the end of the year, two of them (one girl and one boy) get a wild card spot on the pro-circuit tour.
		The first series was released on DVD in 4 volumes, though fans are strongly urging for a complete re-release featuring the entire season in one package as was later done with Series Two.
		Sophie Luck won the 2005 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Young Actor for her role in the series.
		The winners for series one were Fly and Edge.
		Filming of a second series began in early January 2006 in Sydney, Australia, with a revised cast, which included Sophie Luck who was back as Fly, Adam Saunders as Heath, who leaves in episode six and Trent Dalzell as Corey, Ryan Corr as Eric, Lesley Anne Mitchell as Brooke, Taryn Marler as Rachel, Gabrielle Scollay as Amy, and James Sorensen as Mike.
		It premiered on 28 June 2006.
		Sophie Luck, Adam Saunders, Kate Bell, Chris Foy, Tahyna Tozzi, Nadine Garner and Khan Chittenden have all reappeared in the second series in various episodes.
		The winners of Series Two were Brooke and Eric.
		The complete second series was released on DVD in Australia on 1 October 2007.
		The third and final series began filming in October 2007.
		Kate Bell returns as Bec for series three and is joined by Craig Horner as Garry.
		The new Solar Blue pupils are Guy (Kain O'Keeffe), Charley (Lachlan Buchanan), Adam (Eka Darville), Bridget (Cariba Heine), Loren (Amy Beckwith) and Cassie (Rebecca Breeds).
		Series Three began screening on Rollercoaster on 3 April 2008.
		The winners are Bridget and Adam, but Bridget decides to go to university instead of joining the Pro Circuit, so Loren gets the wild card after Cassie literally 'draws the short straw' (as they both have the same number of points in the final surf-off so they decide who gets the wild card this way).
		In the last episode, Simmo makes a surprise return as one of the three judges in what is described as "one of the best finals Solar Blue has seen", saving the day as he pulls "not a rabbit out of a hat, but an elephant", ensuring that the winners of the final surf-off still get a wild card invitation.

		The film is about infighting between visiting prostitutes and fishermen's wives in a small fishing village in rural Southern Chile that has become greedy and crazy for Chilean abalone.
		In Spanish the word loco has the dual meaning of Chilean abalone and crazy.
		The film's tagline was "Amor y avaricia en un mundo de buzos y moluscos" (Spanish for: Love and greed in a world of scuba and mollusks).
		The film's title in German was Das Loco-Fieber and English Loco Fever.

	Much as in The Sensorites, where: 
		The TARDIS travellers land on a moving spaceship and find the crew apparently dead.
		However, one of the crew members, Captain Maitland, regains consciousness and Ian Chesterton fully revives him and another woman, Carol Richmond.
		These two tell the travellers that they are on an exploration mission from Earth and are orbiting Sense-Sphere.
		However, its inhabitants, the Sensorites, refuse to let them leave orbit.
		The Sensorites visit and stop the travellers from leaving, while sending them on a collision course, which the Doctor diverts.
		The travellers then meet John (whose mind has been broken by the Sensorites) and find out that he is Carol's fianc .
		Returning to plague the crew, the Sensorites freeze Carol and Maitland once more.
		The Doctor breaks Maitland's mental conditioning, but cannot help John.
		Susan's telepathic mind is flooded with the many voices of the Sensorites who remain scared of the humans and are trying to communicate with her.
		Meanwhile, the Doctor works out that the Sensorites attacked the human craft because John, a mineralogist, had discovered a vast supply of molybdenum on Sense-Sphere.
		Susan reports that the Sensorites want to make contact with travellers, asking the crew to go aboard Sense-Sphere and reveal that a previous Earth expedition caused them great misery.
		The Doctor refuses but Susan, under duress, agrees and begins to leave the ship.
		The Doctor deduces that the Sensorites need plenty of light, so Ian reduces the lighting on the ship, rendering the Sensorites helpless and rescuing Susan.
		The Doctor then asks the Sensorites to return his lock, and is invited to go to Sense-Sphere to speak with the leader.
		Susan, Ian, Carol and John join him, while Barbara and Maitland stay behind.
		John is promised that his condition will be reversed.
		On their journey to Sense-Sphere, the party learn that the previous visitors from Earth exploited Sense-Sphere for its wealth, then argued.
		Half of them stole the spacecraft, which exploded on take-off.
		The Sensorite Council is divided over the issue of inviting the party to Sense-Sphere: some members plot to kill them on arrival, but others believe that the humans can help with the disease that is currently killing many Sensorites.
		Their first plot is foiled by the other Sensorites, but they continue to plot in secret.
		The humans are not told of the first plot, and John and Carol are cured.
		In the main conference room, Ian starts coughing violently and collapses.
		Suffering from the disease that has blighted the Sensorites, he is told that he will soon die.
		It turns out that he was actually poisoned by drinking water from the general aqueduct.
		The Doctor finds the problematic aqueduct and starts work with the Sensorite scientists.
		The plotting Sensorites capture and then impersonate a Sensorite leader, the Second Elder and steal the new cure, before it is given to Ian, but a new one is made easily and Ian is cured.
		Meanwhile, investigating the aqueduct, the Doctor finds strange noises and darkness.
		He finds and removes deadly nightshade (the cause of the poisoning), but on going back, meets an unseen monster.
		Susan and Ian find him unconscious with his coat torn, but otherwise unharmed.
		On being recovered, he tells of his suspicion that some Sensorites are plotting to kill them.
		The plotting Sensorites kill the Second Elder and one of them replaces him in his position.
		John tells the others that he knows the lead plotter, but he is now too powerful, so the Doctor and Ian go down to the aqueduct to find the poisoners.
		Their weapons and map were tampered with and are useless.
		Elsewhere, a mysterious assailant abducts Carol and forces her to write saying she has left for the ship.
		Neither Susan, John nor Barbara believe this so they go to investigate and find her imprisoned.
		They overpower the guard and release Carol.
		On finding out about the tampered tools, they go into the aqueduct to rescue the Doctor and Ian.
		The leader discovers the plotters a little while later.
		Ian and the Doctor discover that the monsters were actually the survivors of the previous Earth mission, and they had been poisoning the Sensorites.
		Their deranged Commander leads them to the surface, where they are arrested by the Sensorites.
		The Doctor and his party return to the city, pleading clemency for the poisoners.
		The leader of the Sensorites agrees and sends them back with Maitland, John and Carol to Earth, for treatment for madness.
		In the opening scene of episode 1, the characters recap the adventures they've had since joining the Doctor.
		"It all started out as a mild curiosity in a junk yard" and "taken us back to prehistoric times [An Unearthly Child], The Daleks, Marco Polo, Marinus [The Keys of Marinus], and The Aztecs".

Beka begins her
	Much as in Jol Nupur, where: 
		The story revolves around Kajal, a girl from Orissa and an expert in the dance form Odissi, and a man from the city Arin Basu Mallik, named Neel.
		Neel is from a wealthy established family and man of principles, while Kajal or Kaju is soft-hearted and strong character who believes in the basic virtues of life.
		The show is basically a love story of Kaju and Neel in the backdrop of the sea.
		The waves of the sea seem to wash away all differences in their culture and lifestyles and tie them in an internal union.
		Kaju and Arin meet on the sea-beach when Arin had gone there on a holiday.
		Neel develops feelings for Kaju.
		When Neel and Kaju accidentally and unintentionally perform some of the Hindu marriage rituals, the pujaris of the Jagannath temple threat to turn Kaju into a Devdasi and so Kaju becomes forced to marry Neel.
		When the two come to Kolkata, Neel's family members are not ready to accept Kaju and Kaju has to face many hurdles, especially the ill-intended Bhoomi, Neel's elder sister-in-law.
		But she also has some supportive people by her side - Neel's uncle, who is the third son of Purnendusekhar Basu Mallik, head of the family, Neel's aunt, Aparajita (also called Pari) who is a mental patient and a special child.
		Pari also sings beautifully Pari's music teacher and mentor, Amartya.
		Eventually the family members accept Kaju and Kaju wins an Odissi dance competition, defeating Bhoomi.
		Later, we come to know, that Bhoomi is actually Kaju's cousin and Kaju is the daughter of the dance maestro Surya Panigrahi, who is now dead.
		Kajal's mother, Urbhashi and Bhoomi's mother, Srishti Mukherjee, are sistersThe power hungry Srishti had succeeded in establishing herself as an Odissi dancer.
		But soon circumstances demand Neel and Kaju to get divorced due to Arin's friend, Arshi, who in turn marries Neel.
		Kaju happens to leave the Basu Mallik house and seek refuge in the house of an old Odissi dancer.
		Later, we come to know that the man is none other than Surya Panigrahi and Srishti had planned to kill him in order to emerge as an unparalleled dancer.
		So now, Kaju's birth details are unveiledKaju now starts getting trained in Odissi vigorously by her father and wins a national-level dance competition.
		On the other hand, Neel becomes physically weak and ill.
		In the meantime, other affairs creep in - Pari wins a national-level singing competition with the help of Amartya, who had married her also.
		At the same time, both Neel's family and Kaju have to face various calamities due to the ill-intended Bhoomi and Arshi.
		Pari has to face major hurdles, as Amartya's sister-in-law was not ready to accept her.
		Due to certain calamities like Amartya falling sick and losing his voice, force Pari to earn money by singing following which she gets blamed by Amartya's sister-in-law that Pari was a thief.
		Eventually she is proved wrong and her son, Judo, marries Neel's sister.
		Another character, Minu , comes up at this point.
		She happened to be neighbour of the Basu Mallik family when the family used to live in the village.
		She stood by the side of the Basu Mallik family and helped them in their crisis and later married Chhoton, third son of Purnendusekhar.
		Discrepancies creep in even in her married life, when it is revealed that Minu was a widow and this was her second marriage.

		Fatty is made the leader of the Five Find Outers, as he explains that he has been studying how to get out of a locked room when the key is not on his side, to write letters with invisible ink (or orange/lemon juice) and has been practising disguises.
		The Five have fun with Fatty's new techniques, particularly disguises.
		Pip disguises himself with a wig and some sticking out teeth and attracts the attention of Mr Goon, who chases him across the village.
		In an attempt to escape Mr Goon, Pip runs into the grounds of an empty house and climbs a tree.
		He is very surprised to see a fully furnished room at the top of an otherwise empty and apparently abandoned house.
		The Find Outers get to work to discover who owns Milton House, and why there is an apparently secret room.
		Who uses it and why.
		The children trace the owner of the house to the blandly named "John Henry Smith", who lives in a distant town.
		Fatty telephones Mr Smith and alerts him to the fact that someone knows about the secret room.
		Expecting the mysterious Mr Smith to come to Peterswood and check out what is happening at Milton House, Fatty disguises himself with his wig and teeth and goes to the house at midnight.
		He manages to get inside and discovers a notebook written in code in the secret room.
		However, he is captured by the men - who are foreigners - and forced to write a letter to the other children, to try to trap them inside the house.
		Fatty writes a note, but he writes another, secret note in invisible ink, warning the children and telling them to call the police.

		Daughter Vronli, serious, sensible, hard-working and humble, is a maternity nurse in Munich.
		Brother Hans  son, a poor student, is about to graduate and does not want to study medicine, contrary to the wishes of his father, but wants to be a farmer like his admired Uncle Klaus.
		The main character is the youngest daughter, Ursel, seventeen, who has just graduated from school and is very similar to Annemarie.
		Ursel has a beautiful voice and wants to be a singer, but her father insists that she start as a bank clerk.
		The difficult situation between father and daughter escalates angrily for a time, but Annemarie smoothes the waves and devises a compromise: Ursel joins the bank, but takes singing lessons from an aging opera diva.

	Much as in Mortal Kombat (2011 video game), where: 
		The game's director, Ed Boon, described it as an altered re-telling of the events of the first three Mortal Kombat games (Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3): Following the events of , both the forces of light and darkness have been wiped out, with only the thunder god Raiden and the Outworld emperor Shao Kahn remaining to represent their parties.
		A severely weakened Raiden is about to be killed by Shao Kahn, but casts a last-minute spell on the shattered pieces of his magical amulet, directing it to contact his past self with the vague message "He must win".
		During the events of the first tournament hosted by Shang Tsung, the past version of Raiden sees visions of the future courtesy of his cracked amulet.
		Raiden initially comes to the conclusion that fighter Liu Kang is to win the tournament and save Earthrealm from Outworld.
		Pivotal characters such as Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, Jax Briggs, Sektor, Cyrax, Nightwolf, Kitana, Jade, and Sub-Zero are introduced, the latter being killed by the hellspawn Scorpion.
		In time, Liu Kang becomes the only remaining Earthrealm contestant, and succeeds in defeating the Shokan Prince Goro, as well as Shang Tsung.
		However, Raiden's amulet continues to deteriorate, a sign that future events remain unchanged.
		Disappointed with Shang Tsung's failure, Shao Kahn orders his execution, but relents when the sorcerer suggests holding the second tournament in Outworld.
		Raiden initially refuses, but is forced to relent when Shang Tsung threatens to unleash Outworld's armies upon Earthrealm.
		As each of the Earthrealm warriors are defeated, the younger Sub-Zero (originally named Tundra, who adopts the moniker Sub-Zero to honor his fallen brother) and Smoke arrive in Outworld on Lin Kuei terms, who are also fighting in the tournament.
		They are pursued by cybernetic Lin Kuei assassins, including Sektor and Cyrax, who attempt to take them back to Earthrealm for automation.
		Raiden attempts to change the timeline by rescuing Smoke from his transformation, but as a result, the younger Sub-Zero is automated in his place.
		Also during this time, Kitana uncovers the existence of Mileena, a mutant clone of herself crafted by Shang Tsung on Shao Kahn's orders.
		Infuriated by the betrayal, Kitana defects from Kahn and joins the Earthrealm warriors, with Jade following her later on.
		In the final round of the tournament, Raiden once again tampers with the timeline by substituting Kung Lao for Liu Kang, the original winner of the Outworld tournament, as the champion of the second tournament.
		Shao Kahn, however, kills Kung Lao near the end of the tournament, with Liu Kang retaliating and mortally wounding the Outworld emperor.
		Raiden notes the timeline is still unaffected as his amulet continues to deteriorate.
		Healed by the sorcerer Quan Chi, Shao Kahn enters into an alliance with the Netherrealm and has Quan Chi resurrect his wife, Sindel.
		In doing so, they nullify the ward that prevents Kahn's access to Earthrealm, initiating a full-scale invasion.
		Shortly afterwards, Raiden prevents the death of Johnny Cage by slaying Motaro.
		Joined by fighters Kurtis Stryker and Kabal, the Earthrealmers attempt to stop Kahn's invasion, but many of them are killed by Sindel, who had been vastly empowered by the souls extracted from Shang Tsung's body, thus killing the sorcerer.
		Kitana is then overpowered by Sindel's new strength and is brutally beaten.
		Kitana, critically injured, pleads to her mother that Shao Kahn has corrupted her, but Sindel ignores and attempts to finish her off.
		Nightwolf, however, comes in time to stop Sindel and sacrifices himself to kill her.
		Raiden confronts Quan Chi and, learning of the alliance with Kahn, he realizes that the message "He must win" refers to Kahn himself   if he is allowed to merge Outworld and Earthrealm, he will be punished by the Elder Gods for a violation of the Mortal Kombat code for taking a realm without winning the tournament.
		Liu Kang, however, blames Raiden for the death of their allies and attacks an approaching Shao Kahn.
		In an attempt to change history, Raiden accidentally kills Liu Kang.
		Grief-stricken, Raiden "surrenders" to Shao Kahn.
		The Elder Gods intervene, restoring Raiden's strength which he in turn uses to defeat and punish Kahn for breaking the Mortal Kombat code.
		After defeating Kahn, Raiden vows to rebuild Earthrealm with survivors Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade.
		Quan Chi is then revealed to be an agent of Shinnok, who intends to take advantage of the chaos and the elimination of Kahn to conquer both Outworld and Earthrealm in the name of the Netherrealm.

		Michael Donovan (McLaglen), a soldier of fortune and former Marine colonel, is fed up with his latest job: keeping spoiled playboy George Foster (Michael Whalen) out of trouble from women and liquor.
		Thus, he is eager to accept when revolutionaries Valdis (Lumsden Hare) and Ledgard (Walter Kingsford) want to hire him to kidnap King Peter II, ruler of a country somewhere in the Balkans.
		When a drunken Foster wakes up and interrupts their meeting, Donovan calls him his aide.
		Donovan and Foster reconnoiter at a masquerade ball held at the king's palace, but Peter does not make an appearance.
		Foster quickly falls in love with a woman there named Sonia (Gloria Stuart).
		When the two men sneak back into the palace later that night, they are surprised to discover that Peter (Freddie Bartholomew) is just a boy.
		Donovan is too disgusted to want to abduct him, though Peter is thrilled at the idea of an adventure.
		However, when Countess Sonia stumbles upon the scene and raises the alarm, Donovan has no choice.
		Peter helpfully shows him a secret escape passage; Sonia reluctantly goes with them to take care of the lad.
		As prearranged, the kidnappers take Peter to Lady Augusta (Constance Collier), who turns out to be Peter's former nurse.
		Donovan's employers succeed in overthrowing Gino (C.

		As time goes on, Donovan becomes very fond of Peter and vice versa, while Foster convinces Sonia he really does love her.
		However, that does not sway her from what she sees as her duty; she manages to send a message to Gino revealing where the king is being held.
		Peter and Donovan initially evade Gino's men, but are recaptured within sight of the palace.
		Peter orders Gino to release Donovan unharmed, but Gino secretly has him imprisoned.
		Gino tells supporter Prince Edric (Lester Matthews) to start rumors that the new regime has killed the very popular king.
		Edric is aghast, grasping the implication that Gino intends to murder Peter.
		Sonia also realizes her mistake, and frees Donovan and Foster.
		With Foster's help, Donovan kills or captures all 250 of Gino's men just in time to save Peter from a firing squad.
		When Gino resists, Donovan shoots him.

	Much as in Saving General Yang, where: 
		The film is set in the early Northern Song dynasty, AD 986, of northeastern China.
		Former Northern Han general and the patriarch of the Yang clan Yang Ye pledges allegiance to the new Han Chinese-ruled Song regime after Northern Han's fall.
		Years later Yang's seventh son, Yang Yansi, participated in a martial arts tournament with his father's rival Pan Renmei's son Pan Bao in his sixth brother Yang Yanzhao's place to win Later Zhou's former princess Chai Meirong's (who is Yang Yanzhao's childhood sweetheart) hand in marriage, which ended in the latter's death.
		The following morning Yang and Pan meet with the emperor about the issue; Yang executes 30 whiplashes to his young sons as punishment.
		Later, Song's border stations are burned, signaling an invasion from the Khitan-ruled Liao regime.
		The Khitan army hopes to take its revenge on the Yang Clan and their followers for a past defeat that killed a Khitan general ten years previously.
		It was noted that the leader of the invading Khitan army is Yel  Yuan, son of the deceased Khitan general.
		Due to politics and Pan Bao's death, Pan Renmei is awarded with 50,000 troops to repel the Khitan army.
		As punishment, Gen.
		Yang is given a lesser task--to lead the charge and be the scout.
		When the two armies meet, Pan Renmei's lack of experience and inept leadership causes chaos among the Song army, and the Khitan forces emerge with a decisive victory.
		All the while Gen.
		Yang is trapped behind enemy lines in an abandoned town in front of Wolf Mountain.
		The Khitan army surrounds the town, allowing no one to leave.
		Pan, however, refuses to send troops to rescue Yang as revenge.
		This leaves Yang Ye's wife, She Saihua, devastated as she sends her seven sons to rescue him.
		It is later revealed that this is exactly what Yel  Yuan wanted, and the sons fall into his deadly trap.
		Led by the eldest son, Yang Yanping, the seven brothers--including the two youngest, who unlike their brothers have never seen combat--set out with a small band of Yang Clan's elite soldiers to fight through an army of thousands to reach to the Wolf Mountain.
		When they finally arrive in the town, the Khitan army starts bombarding it with catapults and unleashes a fierce attack.
		The seven escape with their father, but are the only ones of the clan to survive; all the soldiers with them are killed.
		In the escape the father is wounded with a poisoned arrow.
		and he ultimately kills himself.
		The sons decide to bring their father's body home for a proper burial and to allow their mother to see her beloved husband one last time.
		Before sending off the seven sons, She Saihua visits a fortune teller, who gives her a slip of paper saying: "Seven will set off, six will return".
		By the end of the film, Yang Yansi dies after Pan's archers fill him full of arrows on Pan's orders after he escaped from Wolf Mountain, and Yel  Yuan personally hunts Yang Ye's surviving sons and kills five of them.
		However, Yang Yanzhao alone defeats and kills Yel  in combat, seemingly proving the prediction wrong.
		It turns out, though, that the message was correct; what it actually meant was that Yang Yanzhao, who was son #6, was the one who would return and have a greater destiny than his siblings.
		He returned with his father's body, the brothers' weapons and Yel  Yuan's severed head.
		Although four of Yang Ye's sons' bodies were recovered, two had never been found.
		After his father's and brothers' funerals, Yang Yanzhao marries Chai Meirong.
		His victory over Yel  Yuan redeemed his father's failure to stop the Khitan army, and the Khitan empress had to halt her assault on the Song empire due to the loss of her general.
		Because of the sons' courageous actions, Yang Yanzhao rises to his late father's position as general and the Yang Clan developed a legendary reputation in China.

		One night in the Old West, a man named Cat tries to ride out of a town and is ambushed by a large number of men.
		He is wounded, but manages to lure them away and hides in a wagon belonging to a circus company.
		Outside town the wagons are searched by men who are shot by Cat and the trapeze artist Thomas, who is a former gunfighter.
		Cat leaves the company as soon as he can travel.
		The same night men arrive and search the wagons during the show and discover traces of him.
		To retaliate they shoot down Thomas  partner Joe during their performance.
		Thomas finds Cat and nurses him back to health saying that he needs him as  bait for my trap.
		  Cat takes him to Hutch, who lives in a house together with another big man, who is called Baby Doll and is a mute.
		Hutch receives Cat with hostility.
		Cat explains that Sharp, a friend of Hutch who is a prospector, needs help to stop mining boss Fisher from taking his claim, and that Cat had won the deed to the claim in a rigged poker game to be able to take it out of town (that is why he was attacked in the beginning).
		Hutch reluctantly agrees to come along, together with Baby Doll.
		They find the remnants of the circus with its manager Mami, refit it, and gather the artists.
		At the mining town a county commissioner arrives to review the claims, but the miners are afraid to talk to him   except for the McGavin family, but they are besieged in their home and eventually destroyed with dynamite by the large outlaw band of Finch, who co-operates with Fisher.
		However, at night a message is delivered to the commissioner in his room by a dwarf (from the circus).
		In the morning the circus arrives, and the commissioner convinces Fisher to invite everybody to the show.
		At the circus show they perform pantomimes about the threat to the miners and the killing of the McGavins.
		The miners find guns under their seats, while Fisher s men find feathers.
		There is a fight and Fisher s men are killed.
		The four go out to face the might of the Finch gang in a nightly fight.
		They get help from the circus people (including dwarves and cancan dancers), and eventually the miners also join in and the gang is wiped out.
		Fisher shoots Mami in the back.
		Cat appears and says it will render Fisher the gallows unless he wants to try his luck with the gun.

However, a ruthless
	Much as in Line of Delirium, where: 
		The first novel, Line of Delirium, takes place decades after a devastating interstellar conflict   the Vague War.
		While the reason for and details of the war remain largely unexplained, it is clear that almost every alien race was at some point involved in hostilities with the humans.
		The war was going badly for Earth, until two Earth officers decided to take matters into their own hands.
		Disobeying orders, they turned their fleet and headed for Earth, demanding the government's surrender.
		One of the officers, a man named Grey, established the Human Empire and became the emperor.
		His co-conspirator Lemak became the supreme commander of all human forces.
		While it is not exactly clear how the tide was turned, it is known that all races opposing the new empire were eventually beaten.
		Two of which, the cyborg Meklar and the ursine Bulrathi formed a subsequent pact with the humans   the Trinary Alliance, creating a nearly unbeatable force (humans excel at ship-to-ship combat, Meklar are master engineers, and Bulrathi are superb ground combatants).
		Close to the end of the war, a man named Curtis van Curtis acquires an alien device he calls "aTan" (from athanatos, "immortal" [Greek:         , literally, "without death"] ) giving immortality to anyone who can afford it.
		He formed the aTan company, which quickly became almost as powerful as the Human Empire (as some characters in the novel call it, "an empire within an empire").
		The secret of the device is coveted by many, as the aTan company holds exclusive rights, with Emperor Grey's grudging approval (in exchange he gets free reincarnations).
		Kay Altos is a professional bodyguard whose homeworld was destroyed by the imperial forces after it was invaded by the Sakkra   a fast-multiplying frog-shaped race, which was subsequently exterminated by the Empire.
		One fine morning he wakes up to face a teenager holding a gun, trying to avenge his sister's accidental death at Kay's hands.
		Kay's main problem   he did not have time to pay for his next reincarnation.
		He tries to trick the kid but ends up dying anyway.
		He is surprised to find himself in an aTan facility on Terra   the capital of the Empire with none other than Curtis van Curtis himself greeting him.
		Van Curtis hires Altos to safely bring his only son Arthur to an obscure planet known as Grail.
		Van Curtis's main concern is anyone finding out that Arthur is his son and kidnapping him in order to find out his father's secrets.
		Kay's payment should he succeed   unlimited free reincarnations.
		His payment in case of failure   eternal torture and executions.
		Kay agrees, and a backstory is created where Kay Ovald is a space merchant, travelling with his son Arthur, when their ship explodes.
		After reincarnating on a planet in the middle of a civil war, Imperial Security officer Isabella Kal recognizes Arthur and begins to chase him all over the Empire, even going as far as asking Admiral Lemak for help.
		Unfortunately for Arthur van Curtis and his bodyguard, Kal is not the only one seeking to stop them.
		A mysterious race known as the Silicoids seem to know of Arthur's mission to Grail and wish to prevent him from reaching his goal in order to preserve the galactic balance.
		Kay and Arthur board a luxury liner to the next planet on their way to Grail.
		Altos knows that, in all likelihood, Imperial Security is waiting for them at their destination.
		They manage to get passage on a shuttle, dropping off several passengers on a world close to their course.
		By a stroke of misfortune, that shuttle is stopped by a quarantine ship, and all passengers are secretly taken to a planet belonging to the Darloks   an ancient race exceptional at espionage and sabotage.
		Kay and Arthur soon discover that the Darloks plan to turn them into their agents and also manage to learn the Darloks' true form (unlike Master of Orion, Darloks here are not shapeshifters but Goa'uld-like snake parasites).
		It is there that Kay first meets Viacheslav Shegal   an agent of "Shield", Emperor's special forces.
		He helps Shegal commit suicide (to be reincarnated on a human world), so that the true nature of Darloks is known to all.
		Meanwhile, a massive Silicoid fleet arrives and proceeds to bombard the planet from orbit.
		Troops are sent in to retrieve Kay and Arthur and bring them before Sedimin   the Foot of the Silicoid Basis (a rank equal to emperor).
		Sedimin wants to know the true mission that van Curtis entrusted to Arthur.
		It is on the Silicoid ship that Arthur finally reveals to Kay an awful truth   he is not Curtis van Curtis's son.
		Arthur is a clone and, as such, has no rights under Imperial law.
		As Arthur puts it, "immortals need no heirs".
		Since Arthur is being honest, Kay reveals that his true name is Kay Dutch and that he is a super   a genetically engineered being with increased speed, strength, memory, and other characteristics much higher than a normal human.
		By law, Kay also has no rights, but his past was covered up by a senator who adopted him.
		While Arthur still hides his true mission goal from Kay, he reveals it to Sedimin, who decides to let them go.
		They are dropped off on Tauri   a paradise planet for retired Imperial officers and their families.
		While Kay is out purchasing a ship, Arthur is kidnapped by Isabella Kal.
		Kay's determination to free Arthur is guided less by his obligation to his client than his friendship with the boy.
		His first destination, however, is the planet where he was killed prior to being recruited by van Curtis.
		He finds his killer, a teenager named Tommy Arano, and, instead of killing him, takes him to his hypership that was left on the planet.
		The next morning, Kay explains to Tommy that he is, in fact, Arthur van Curtis, whose mind was wiped by the Silicoids on one of his previous attempts to reach Grail.
		The mind-wiped Arthur was given to a human family to raise as their son, while another Arthur was reincarnated by "aTan" back on Terra because the machine assumed he died.
		Kay and Tommy then head to an Imperial planet almost entired ruled by a crime syndicate known as 'the Family'.
		The Mother of the Family is his genetic sister, also created in a test tube.
		She uses the Family's resources to locate Arthur on a heavily defended Imperial station.
		She agrees to given them all they need to retrieve the boy: outfit their ship with a masking device, provide them with advanced power armor and weapons (including an "Excalibur" tachion rifle for Kay that shoots a full second before the trigger is pulled), and four soldiers   two conditioned humans, a human cyborg, and a Meklar.
		Kay has himself souped-up with artificial enhancements (drastically shortening his lifespan).
		The strike group manages to infiltrate the base and fight their way to the medical wing, where Arthur is being tortured.
		Once Arthur is retrieved, they fight back to the ship, losing the two conditioned soldiers.
		In the hangar bay, Kay faces off against a Meklar working for Isabella Kal and is probably the first human (or almost-human) to pose a challenge to a twelve-foot-long mechanized reptile.
		Kay's Meklar companion clashes with the Imperial Security Meklar, giving the others time to escape.
		Once aboard his ship, Kay finds out that, due to his torture, Arthur is dying.
		Their only hope is to make it to Grail before he dies.
		When they finally make it Grail's orbit, another obstacle awaits them   Admiral Lemak and Isabella Kal on an Imperial destroyer.
		While Kay is trying to find a way out, his ship's illegal AI makes its own decision and the ship into the destroyer's shields.
		While Kay, Tommy, and Arthur are being reincarnated in Grail's branch of aTan, Kal forces Lemak to have her shot, so that she can follow them.
		The two clones and the bodyguard manage to make it to Grail's Dead Zone   an area on the planet where most mechanical devices fail for no apparent reason.
		It is there that Arthur finally reveals to Kay his true mission and the reason for van Curtis to have a clone: Curtis van Curtis did not obtain the "aTan" device from aliens.
		Van Curtis discovered Grail during the Vague War.
		There he found God or rather a being/machine that created the universe.
		God made van Curtis an offer   a universe created based on his subconscious desires, just like this universe was created for someone else.
		Van Curtis asked for more time to think about it.
		God then gave van Curtis the knowledge to create a device allowing him to live forever.
		Finally, after many decades, Curtis van Curtis decides to find out how new universes are created and sell these universes to the public.
		Kay realizes that this would destroy the Empire and attempts to stop them, but finds out that neither Tommy and Arthur nor Curtis van Curtis (who suddenly apprears) can be killed in the Dead Zone.
		Van Curtis takes Arthur and Tommy and leads them to the Threshold, but Tommy refuses and opts to leave with Kay instead.
		The novel ends as they both walk towards an uncertain future.
		Emperors of Illusions is the second novel, continuing the story of Kay Dutch as he travels with Tommy Arano, trying to stop Curtis van Curtis from destroying the Human Empire.
		They believe he is trying to do that to get back at the person he believes responsible for the creation of this universe   Emperor Grey.
		The only way Kay thinks he can stop van Curtis is by killing the Emperor, a virtual impossibility.
		"Shadows of Dreams" is a short prequel to "Line of Delirium" that describes life on a small quiet human colony that is turned upside down when a Psilon battleship enters the system, still believing that the Vague War is on.
		The Psilons are the most advanced race in the galaxy, with only two or three troopers wearing power armor necessary to destroy an entire city.
		As the colonists prepare for a hopeless battle, one man reflects on his life thus far.

	Much as in So Long at the Fair, where: 
		In 1889, young Englishwoman Vicky Barton (Jean Simmons) and her brother Johnny (David Tomlinson) arrive in Paris to see the Exposition Universelle.
		This is Vicky's first time in Paris, and after checking into a hotel, she drags her tired brother to dinner and the famous Moulin Rouge.
		She finally retires for the night, while Johnny has a late-night drink.
		When English painter George Hathaway (Dirk Bogarde) drops off his girlfriend, Rhoda O'Donovan (Honor Blackman), and her mother (Betty Warren) at the hotel, he asks Johnny for change for a 100 franc note to pay a carriage driver; Johnny loans him 50 francs and gives him his name and room number.
		The next morning, Vicky finds a blank wall where Johnny's room used to be.
		When she questions hotel owner and manager Madame Herv  (Cathleen Nesbitt), the latter claims she arrived alone.
		The room number now adorns the common bathroom.
		Madame Herv 's brother Narcisse (Marcel Pontin) and the day porter (Eugene Deckers) back up her story.
		Frantic, Vicky goes to see the British consul (Felix Aylmer), followed secretly by Narcisse.
		She has no proof of her brother's existence, so the consul can only suggest she find a witness, Nina (Zena Marshall), the hotel maid who attended her.
		Nina had informed her that she was going up in a balloon with her boyfriend at the Exposition that day, so the consul takes her there.
		Tragically, she is too late.
		Before she can talk to Nina, the balloon ascends, bursts into flames, and plummets to the ground, killing the two passengers.
		Vicky tries the French police commissaire (Austin Trevor).
		He questions Madame Herv  and her brother, but can find nothing amiss in their story.
		Since her room has been reserved for only two nights, Vicky has to leave the hotel.
		Madame Herv  offers her a ticket home to England, which she is forced to accept, as she has little money left.
		However, unbeknownst to either party, Rhoda O'Donovan has been asked by George Hathaway to deliver a letter containing his loan repayment to Johnny.
		Not finding his room, Rhoda slips the envelope under Vicky's door, where she finds it.

		Victoria has been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany, putting her relationship with Ted in jeopardy.
		Both are unsure, but have always believed that long distance relationships never work; according to Ted, it's a lie teenagers use to get laid the summer before college, while Marshall and Lily say that they are all talk and no sex.
		Marshall needs a new suit for an important interview for an internship position at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
		Barney tells him that he will take Marshall to his tailor and get a discount for it, and outfits Marshall with a very nice suit.
		Ted accompanies them and continues to agonize over his problem with Victoria.
		Meanwhile, Victoria and Robin take Lily shopping for a wedding dress, but cannot find anything she likes in her price range.
		Robin gets tipsy on free champagne and tries to manipulate Victoria into going to Germany, since Robin wants to break them up so she can make a move on Ted, but eventually accepts that Victoria and Ted are really in love.
		In helping Ted and Victoria make their decisions, Marshall and Lily tell two versions of the same story: During college, Lily took a summer art class in Paris.
		According to Marshall, Lily met this strange man named Gabriel; Marshall thought he was moving in on Lily, so when he visited her he told Gabriel to stay away from Lily.
		According to Lily, she was good friends with a homely girl who was self-conscious about her mustache named Gabrielle, who suddenly stopped talking to Lily about halfway through the summer, leaving Lily friendless.
		Neither of them knows the other's story.
		Just for fun, Victoria gets one of the nice dresses from the front window, which Lily loves; she cannot afford it, but accidentally sits down in the free cake provided by the bridal shop, and then rips the dress.
		Later at the bar, Marshall gets the bill for the suit from Barney and finds out that he must pay $4,000 for it, even though Barney promised him a great deal, and realizes it must be a ruse by Barney to get him to accept a high-paying job at Barney's firm, something which Barney attempts to deny.
		He turns to Lily and says he'll do whatever it takes to pay it off, at which point Lily breaks down and reveals that she ruined, and thus had to purchase, an $8,000 dress; Marshall, his back to the wall and with no other option to pay $12,000 plus the money for the wedding, decides to go work for Barney.
		Ted and Victoria meet for dinner having made their respective decisions: Ted thinks she should go, while Victoria thinks she should stay.
		However, they both impulsively change their minds after Victoria hands Ted a cupcake.

		The sight of his huge dog, coming upon her suddenly, so startles Jane that she jumps to her feet, causing Lord Rochester's horse to shy and throw its rider.

		One evening the maniac escapes from her nurse and sets fire to the room in which Lord Rochester has fallen asleep.
		He is saved from a horrible death by Jane.
		When next Jane's haughty aunt and cousins call upon Lord Rochester, they are just in time to be introduced to his bride, who is none other than the despised Jane Eyre".

	Much as in Ecco: The Tides of Time, where: 
		The Tides of Time continues from the ending of the original game, in which Ecco had saved his dolphin pod and the Earth from the Vortex aliens.
		Still wielding the powers granted to him by the ancient life-form known as the Asterite, Ecco has since returned to his peaceful life in Earth's waters.
		One day, while Ecco is out exploring an underwater cave, a powerful earthquake goes off and causes an avalanche.
		As Ecco recovers, he discovers that the Asterite's powers have left him (indicated by the return of his need to surface for air).
		His fellow dolphins explain that something has killed the Asterite and is now spreading fear among the ocean life.
		Soon after, Ecco meets a dolphin with unusually long fins.
		She is his descendant, Trellia, who takes him to the distant future to speak with "an old friend".
		In the future, the ocean has developed its own mind and is connected across the planet by waterways traveling through the sky.
		The dolphins of the future have also evolved, as they are now able to fly through a combination of internal helium sacs and telekinetic powers.
		After exploring the future, Ecco finds his old friend the Asterite, who explains the events that had transpired in Ecco's time.
		Though Ecco had defeated the Vortex, the Vortex Queen survived and followed him back to Earth, where she killed the Asterite of Ecco's time and now nests and feeds to restore her brood.
		The Asterite then tells Ecco that when he used the Atlantean Time Machine to save his pod, he split the stream of time in two.
		One possible future for Earth is a bright, happy world of flying dolphins, while the other is a dead, mechanical world sucked dry by the Vortex.
		As a result, Ecco is referred to as "the stone that split the stream of time in two".
		Once back in his own time, Ecco travels to the Moray Abyss, where he finds the first two globes of the Asterite after clearing out the giant moray eels.
		He then journeys to revive the Asterite by finding its many globes that have been scattered across the ocean.
		Slowly, the Asterite begins to recover, and eventually is able to hold a full conversation with Ecco.
		However, it cannot help Ecco, as the Vortex of the dark future took its last pair of globes back to their own time.
		As the Atlantean Time Machine can only go into the past, Ecco must find another way to reach the dark future.
		Ecco makes his way to the Lunar Bay, which the Vortex have stripped of all ocean life as they continue to grow and multiply.
		As he explores, Ecco is ambushed by Vortex drones and taken to the dark future.
		Unlike the future of before, the Vortex Future is a lifeless planet-spanning machine consisting of water tubes, artificial gravity, and dangerous Vortex creatures.
		Ecco locates the Asterite's last two globes in a chamber, where a bubble-chained holding device called the Globe Holder resides.
		After destroying it, Ecco obtains the globes and is warped back to his era.
		With the Asterite complete again, Ecco's former powers are restored, and the Asterite summons all of Ecco's fellow dolphins to join in fighting the Vortex.
		As the dolphins and the Vortex do battle in the now-transformed Lunar Bay, Ecco swims to the deepest parts and infiltrates the Vortex's New Machine, then finally confronts the Vortex Queen and seemingly destroys her once and for all.
		As his pod celebrates their victory over the vanquished Vortex, Ecco returns to the Asterite and is told to go to Atlantis and destroy the Time Machine in order to prevent the stream of time from ever being split again.
		Arriving in the sunken city, Ecco discovers that the Vortex Queen is still alive as a larva after her supposed death, and the two of them race to the Time Machine.
		The Vortex Queen uses the Time Machine first and is sent to the Prehistoric Era, where she finds herself unable to rule over the creatures that reside there.
		Faced with the need to survive, the Queen is forced to adapt to Earth's own life-cycles, and through the eons, the Vortex are integrated into the ecosystems of Earth as arthropods.
		Ecco chooses to use the Time Machine instead of destroying it, and vanishes into an unknown era.

		Frankie lives in a small apartment on Division Street with his wife, Sophie (nicknamed "Zosh").
		Sophie has been using a wheelchair since a drunk-driving accident caused by Frankie (although the novel implies that her paralysis is psychological in nature).
		She spends most of her time looking out the window and watching the nearby elevated rail line.
		She takes out her frustrations by fighting with her husband, and she uses his guilt to keep him from leaving her.
		The turmoil in their relationship only spurs on his addiction.
		He works nights dealing in backroom card games operated by "Zero" Schwiefka.
		He aspires to join the Musicians' Union and work with jazz drummer Gene Krupa, but this dream never materializes.
		His constant companion and prot g  is "Sparrow" Saltskin, a feeble-minded thief who specializes in stealing and selling dogs; Frankie gets Sparrow a job as a "steerer", watching the door to the card games and drawing in gamblers.
		Often referring to his drug habit as the "thirty-five-pound monkey on his back", Frankie initially tries to keep Sparrow and the others in the dark about it.
		He sends Sparrow away whenever he visits "Nifty Louie" Fomorowski, his supplier.
		One night, while fighting in a back stairwell, Frankie inadvertently kills Nifty Louie.
		He and Sparrow attempt to cover up his role in the murder.
		Meanwhile, Frankie begins an affair with a childhood friend, "Molly-O" Novotny, after her abusive husband is arrested.
		Molly helps Frankie fight his addiction, but they soon become separated when Frankie is imprisoned for shoplifting and she moves out of the neighborhood.
		Without Molly, he begins using drugs again when he is released.
		Nifty Louie owed money to politically connected men, and finding his killer becomes a priority for the police department.
		Sparrow is held for questioning by the police, and he is moved from station to station to circumvent Habeas corpus requirements.
		Eventually he breaks down and reveals what he knows, and Frankie is forced to flee.
		While on the run, Frankie manages to find Molly at a strip club near Lake Street.
		He hides in her apartment and beats his addiction, but in the end the authorities learn where he is hiding.
		He barely manages to escape and gets shot in the foot, leaving Molly behind.
		He flees to a flophouse, but without any hope of reuniting with Molly or staying free, he hangs himself in his room on April Fools' Day, 1948.
		The novel ends with a transcript of the coroner's inquest, as well as a poem for Frankie entitled "Epitaph".

		The film opens on Baxter and Annie Fang (Jack McCarthy and Mackenzie Smith) holding hands in the back of their parents car as their father Caleb (Jason Butler Harner) dons a security guard uniform.
		The family enters a bank and Baxter uses a gun to rob a teller of all her lollipops.
		Baxter shoots his gun when Caleb rushes him, while posing as a security guard.
		Their mother Camille (Kathryn Hahn) pretends to be shot, and Annie grieves over her prone body.
		When the family gets up and leaves, Caleb gives a speech to the bank patrons about cherishing life and takes a bow.
		The adult Annie (Nicole Kidman) is a successful actress on a film set where the director has surprised her by asking her to go topless in a scene.
		After initially refusing, she returns to the set without her top.
		A crew member snaps her photo and sells it to a tabloid.
		The adult Baxter (Jason Bateman) sees the photos in a convenience store.
		He is out of sorts after having published two novels, and he accepts a job writing about potato guns.
		Baxter gets drunk with his subjects and allows them to perform the William Tell trick on him, which results in him getting shot in the ear and hospitalized.
		The Fangs reunite due to Baxter's injury.
		Caleb enlists Annie and Baxter, whom he calls "A and B", into a new piece of performance art.
		Annie hands out fake coupons for free chicken sandwiches at an open air food court.
		Caleb tasks Baxter with filming the chaos that will ensue when the cashier declines to honor them and customers get mad.
		To his dismay, the cashier gives free sandwiches to everyone who asks for one.
		Caleb becomes irate, while Annie and Baxter feel that their parents have lost whatever artistic merit they used to have.
		During their reunion, Annie watches old tapes of the family's performance art, as well as a documentary about her parents shot by Hobart Waxman (Harris Yulin).
		The film captures Caleb's sophomoric and didactic performance pieces, like shooting Hobart with a crossbow.
		Annie also recalls another piece that featured her and Baxter performing outsider music in Central Park with songs like "KAP (Kill All Parents)".
		Camille and Caleb heckle the kids, which horrifies the small crowd of onlookers.
		Later, the family laughs about the piece.
		After a short while, Caleb and Camille disappear.
		Their car is found with blood on the dashboard.
		Annie tells the cops that the blood is fake and the disappearance is just another of Caleb's pieces.

		Annie becomes obsessed with solving their disappearance.
		Annie recalls a performance of Romeo and Juliet in her senior year of high school where Romeo could not make the performance.
		Baxter was tasked with standing in for him, but he balked at having to kiss his sister onstage.
		He reluctantly agrees to do it, but when the audience laughs at his attempts to avoid kissing Annie, she is humiliated.
		Baxter finally gives Annie a fully romantic kiss onstage to the horror of the principal.
		He fires the drama teacher, Miss Delano (Linda Emond), who reveals to Annie and Baxter that losing her job was worth it to be a part of one of Caleb and Camille's more elaborate pieces.
		Annie and Baxter are horrified to realize that they were unwittingly made to kiss, and that was the beginning of the end of their performances with their parents.
		Later, in the documentary, Caleb confesses that until he realized he could use his children as living art, he was uninterested in being a father.
		When the siblings are having a yard sale, they put on one of their parents CDs by a band called the Vengeful Virgins.
		They are stunned to hear a cover of "KAP", which was known only to the Fangs.
		They track down the teenage twin brothers in the band, and Annie interrogates them about the song while Baxter searches their house.
		He finds a videotape of Caleb cutting open his arm and smearing blood on the dashboard of his car.
		A short time later, Miss Delano comes home and reveals she is the boys' mother.
		Caleb enters the house behind her, and he reluctantly agrees to take Annie and Baxter to see their mother.
		Caleb and Camille reveal that they have been planning this final piece for years.
		Caleb has spent time living together with Miss Delano as husband and wife, and accidentally fathered the twin boys.
		Camille has been spending time in a remote small town, posing as a widow for several months of each year.
		They had each established separate identities and believed that this final piece would be a fitting end to their career.
		They beg Annie and Baxter to help them keep their secret.

		During their lives, they interact with Lana and Boso, twin fawns of their Aunt Rolla.
		One day, Gurri is attacked by a fox, but survives because the hunter shoots the fox at the last moment.
		She is then taken away by a hunter (known only as  He  by some of the animals; in the English translation, he is referred to as a gamekeeper, and the name has been changed to the "brown He" because of a brown coat he wears, but such detail is never mentioned in the German text).
		When she is brought to the "He's" place, she meets his dog, Hector, and a European eagle-owl that He captured a while ago.
		The owl is kept in a cage, and he tells Gurri about the times when He uses him as a bait to attack crows and other birds of prey and shoots them.
		Then Bambi finds her, and he tells Gurri that he will come every night to teach her how to jump over the fence.
		But when "He" sees the tracks of Bambi in the corral, He sets Gurri free.
		When she comes back, tensions between her family and Rolla's family start to rise.

		Then one day, Rolla gets attacked by a wolfdog, Nero.
		While trying to escape him, she accidentally lures the wolfdog to where Faline and the others are hiding.
		The wolfdog immediately turns his attention to Geno, and chases him instead.

		When they see Rolla, Gurri gives her a warm welcome, while Boso starts developing a grunt for them.

		When Geno gets older, he meets Lana again.
		Boso comes out and challenges Geno to a fight, but Geno refuses.
		Boso starts to call Geno a coward.
		Only at a third encounter, when Geno thinks no witnesses are around to see Boso humiliated, he fights Boso and defeats him; he offers a truce, but Boso instead turns away.
		One day, Boso is shot by a boy hunter, but before the boy can kill him he escapes.
		He then runs into Bambi, and Bambi has him use the same techniques that his father, the Great Prince, told him to use when he got wounded.
		The boy later returns to the meadow and tries to kill a deer from a pack, thinking that Faline or Rolla are bucks, but right when he is about to shoot, Bambi jumps out and charges him down.
		In the end, the two families end their feud and become friends again.
		At the end, Faline lets her children go their own paths.

		Asamiya captures Higashiyama, while Amaki is saved from her bomb by the school janitor Jirou Kimura (Shunsuke Kubozuka), who had become friends with Saki earlier.
		Kira interrogates Higashiyama, and he informs Saki that the Enola Gay site is run by a user named Romeo; unfortunately, Higashiyama is abducted, and Asamiya is forced to fight Romeo's gang of thugs.
		Afterwards, Tae tells Saki that he and a fellow bullied schoolgirl named Kotomi Kanda (Erika Miyoshi) ran together an anti-bullying website, until Kanda snapped and tried to commit suicide by bombing, being left catatonic in a hospital while their site was replaced by the Enola Gay website.
		Reika interrupts them and reveals that Kotomi fell in love with a man who advised her to blow herself up.
		Going to the hospital, Saki and Tae visit Kotomi, who only says the name of Jirou Kimura.
		Revealed to be Romeo, Kimura kidnaps Saki and ties her to a bomb, which she is left to escape from.
		Similarly, Reika discovers herself as Romeo's lover, and she hosts an assembly on the school in front of all the students and teachers in order to celebrate his ideology.
		Meanwhile, Romeo and his gang are capitalizing on the event to rob a bank in Tokyo.
		Tae is brought to the room and strapped to another bomb, and after some dramatic exchanges she is saved by the returning Saki.
		The girl chases Reika, who still has Tae as her hostage and attempts to reunite with Romeo, and ends up facing her in a singles duel.
		It's revealed that Reika is a former operative of Tokumei Keiji, a police program similar to Sukeban Deka, and that she has her own armed yo-yo, which sports blades.
		They fight, and although the less experienced Asamiya is overpowered when trying to user her weapon, she defeats Reika by burying her under metal pipes.
		Saki then confronts Romeo and his gang, who have Tae, Amaki and Higashiyama as bomb-strapped hostages, and manages to take the villains out thanks to a bulletproof uniform.
		Eventually Romeo, who wears a bomb as well, disables her yo-yo by slicing the string with his katana, but she still knocks him out.
		Saki takes the artifacts off the hostages, leaving Romeo's to explode on him, killing him.
		Later, Saki calls her mom (Yuki Saito), who is revealed to be the first ever Saki Asamiya.
		Kira then informs he has got another work for her, and she bids farewell to Tae and Kotomi before leaving the school.

	Much as in Dhamaal, where: 
		The story is about four good-for-nothing friends: Boman Contractor (Aashish Chaudhary), Roy (Riteish Deshmukh), Aditya 'Adi' Srivastav (Arshad Warsi), and his dim witted younger brother Manav (Javed Jaffrey).
		The story starts when the four are kicked out of their house by their landlady (Suhasini Mulay) for not paying their rents, for stealing her pizza, and for lying to her that Adi has a sister who has cancer and that they needed money for her treatment.
		Desperate to earn money, they devise up a plan.
		Adi tells Manav to steal a painting of a 'horse eating grass' from the house.
		They decide it to sell it to the son of the late Businessman Dwiwedi.
		But Manav accidentally picks up a blank painting not knowing the reality.
		They humorously sell the painting for Rs.
		20,000 to him after knowing that Manav has picked up the wrong painting.
		They then pick up the original painting with the intention to sell it to mr Agarwal not knowing that he has been murdered.
		The case is handled by  Inspector Kulkarni (Murli Sharma).
		He learns that before mr Agrawal was murdered he was speaking on the phone to somebody and he mentioned the words 'horse' and 'grass'.
		He interprets these words to be some code language.
		Unfortunately the four arrive at Agrawal's residence.
		Kulkarni demands to see the painting.
		Seeing the horse and grass he immediately arrests them.
		While travelling on the highway Kulkarni drops the four on the road after realising that they are innocent.
		The four are overjoyed when suddenly they witness a car accident.
		The car belongs to the Don Bose (Prem Chopra).
		In his last words he tells them that he has hidden a treasure of 10 Crores in the st Sabastian garden in Goa under a big 'W'.
		He tells them to divide the money equally among themselves.
		They come across Inspector Kabir Nayak (Sanjay Dutt) who has been trying to arrest Bose for the past ten years.
		He tries to extract information from the four but in vain.
		They escape from there and decide to travel to Goa.
		Desperate for his promotion, Kabir is determined to capture the four.
		All four friends steal Boman's car which belongs to his father Nari (Asrani).
		Nari loves his car more than his son.
		He threw his son out after he damaged his car.
		The friends manage to steal their car but not before hitting Nari on the head and making him unconscious.
		Unfortunately Roy loses control of the car in a forest and hits it against a tree breaking both headlights.
		They decide to spend the night in the car.
		The next day Kabir is transferred to Yavatmal for failing to capture Bose.
		Furious he walks towards his table where Nari is waiting for him to file a complaint against his son for stealing his car.
		He gives Kabir the photos of Boman and his car.
		Meanwhile all four come across a broken bridge which is the only way through the forest.
		They decide to jump the car but Boman is reluctant to do so.
		Unfortunately they manage to jump the car on the other side but it blasts off.
		Kabir tracks the four down after discovering the destroyed car.
		He is able learns the location of the treasure due to Manav's dumbness.
		He ties all four of them to a tree and sets off.
		However they manage to escape and it is revealed that Roy had actually cut the engine wires of Kabir's car so he must have not gone too far.
		They reach a dhabha and pretend to be detectives.
		They make the villagers believe that Kabir is a member of the Pasha gang and lures them to capture him for the reward would be Rs.
		15 lakhs.
		Unfortunately Kabir defeats the villagers and he and the four arrive at a settlement - 60% would belong to the four and 40% would belong to Kabir.
		But Boman insists on having his money separately for damaging his car from the rest of the three.
		Consequently a fight ensues and is decided that whoever reaches the treasure first would take all the money.
		All four part ways and try to reach Goa as soon as possible.
		Roy encounters a terrorist Babubhai (Sanjay Mishra) and agree to divide the money among themselves provided they reach Goa as soon as possible.
		Boman also encounters his father.
		Though Nari initially wants to kill his son, changes his mind after he learns about the ten crores.
		Adi and Manav travel together.
		Kabir nearly escapes death as he hangs off a cliff and is rescued by some school children whose school bus he stole.
		All of them go through a series of humorous adventures before reaching Goa.
		Unfortunately all of them (except Kabir) reach the garden at the same time.
		Finally Roy explains that it is useless finding the treasure alone and all agree to find the money together.
		They all search for the big 'W'.
		Manav is able to locate the Palm trees which make the shape of a 'W' when a crow poos on Adi.
		But Kabir arrives there and tells them to divide the money against them to which all agree.
		They dig there and are able to find the money.
		But again a fight ensues over the payment for the damage of the car.
		All are enraged when Adi and Manav decide to pay the money as one unit but are separate units while taking money.
		The fight goes on during which Kabir takes all the money and runs.
		He tries to escape in a hot air balloon on a beach but finds it tied to a pole.
		He dives in an effort to cut the rope but is beaten up by the rest who pursue him.
		The balloon blows off shore and all are disheartened.
		Conditions change when the wind changes direction and the balloon again blows onshore.
		They follow the balloon in a towing van.
		The balloon clashes against a pole and the bag falls down.
		All of them try to collect as much money as they can when suddenly some spot lights focus on them and a crowd cheers loudly behind them.
		They are actually standing in stage where a function is being held by an organisation named 'Help Orphans'.
		Seeing the money everybody thinks they have come here to donate money.
		All of them get emotional and all decide to donate the money for the orphans.
		The film ends on a happy note conveying that the fate of the money was already decided.
		It never belonged to the four friends.
		They were just a medium which helped the money reach its true destination.

		However, Cyril Sneer and Snag aren't happy with the party, as they want some sleep, and they set about to try and stop the music.
		They manage to pull the plug on their party (literally) when they find out that their power supply is plugged in back at his mansion, so he unplugs it and all the power goes off, with his evil laughter echoing throughout the Evergreen Forest, but Bert manages to restore the power back on and the party is saved, much to Cyril and Snag's dismay.

		Under Clark and Lois' enlightened rule, Metropolis has begun to progress.
		However, some resist that progress, such as dr Arkham, the head of an asylum, who holds "psychomantic" seances for the entertainment of the depraved rich of Metropolis.
		The star of these is the "Laughing Man", a white-faced, murderous creature, a prototype cyborg built by Lutor from one of Arkham's patients.
		Many other patients in the asylum are also experiments of Lutor, driven mad by his work.
		When Eschevin Gordon tries to close Arkham down, the doctor sends the Laughing Man to kill him.
		Attorney Dirk Grayson becomes suspicious of Arkham, but he, too, is killed by the Laughing Man.
		Dirk's friend, Bruss Wayne, and their mutual love-interest Barbera Gordon, are then drawn to investigate Arkham, after being turned down by the police and apparently ignored by the Super-Man and Lois, who have greater concerns that require his attention.
		Wayne discovers Arkham is in league with the new Chancellor, Henderson, and that the two are manipulating the city's aristocrats via knowledge of their secrets and the shows in the cabinet.
		He also hears the two plotting to kill both himself and Barbera with the Laughing Man.
		But, during an attempted escape by the inmates in the asylum, he is captured and thrown into a great pit, at the bottom of which lie vast, sentient computers who once built Metropolis and still sustain it and watch over humanity.
		They turn Wayne into the "Nosferatu" and send him back to the city above.
		The Nosferatu saves Barbera and kills the Laughing Man, before attacking Arkham in his asylum.
		As he fights the orderlies, the inmates hail him as "the Master".
		While confronting both dr Arkham and Henderson, the latter armed with a gun scavenged from Lutor's old lair and powered by the green stone taken from Lutor's chest, the Super-Man appears to investigate at Wayne-son's behest and is wounded by the weapon before the Nosferatu hurls Hender-son from the tower.
		He is then confronted by the Superman, who believes there is no place for creatures of shadow in his city of light, while the Nosferatu calls him na ve and claims the inmates as his responsibility.
		They fight, eventually falling down into the underworld.
		Their battle is inconclusive, with each mortally wounding the other.

		The unusualness of the socio-cultural background of these two characters is delicately portrayed by Sahoo in a sensitive and convincing manner.
		Readers become familiar with the two sets of roles that Kuki plays; that of a lover and that of a wife.
		Sahoo subtly balances these two roles and at the same time, highlights the superiority of a wife in a pragmatic world.

		Both nations are 'cooperating' in various areas of research (particularly rocketry) at the newly built Demidenko research facility in Ukraine.
		Thanks to the foreknowledge granted by the Transition, Hitler and Stalin have purged their military and party ranks of traitors (real and imagined) that have been revealed from our history.
		Though not without problems: the arrest of Field Marshal Rommel sparks off a mutiny amongst the Afrika Korps that throws the entire North African front into chaos.
		Most of the German war machine shifts to "Operation Sea Dragon": the invasion of Britain.
		Meanwhile, in the Pacific, the Japanese have conquered New Guinea and the nearby island chains, and are battling Allied forces (reinforced with troops from the Multinational Force) along the Brisbane Line in Australia.
		In the United States a "Special Administrative Zone" has been carved out within the San Fernando Valley of California.
		Within "the Zone", the laws of the United States as of January 15, 2021 apply and it becomes an enclave for the 21st Century personnel.
		Many of the Multinational Force's members work in various technological areas and thousands of contemporary females and non-whites are clamoring to join their ranks.
		Over the next month the Japanese position in northern Australia unravels after a massive blitzkrieg of 21st Century armor is unleashed.
		Japanese soldiers massacre entire towns, prompting both outrage and a reluctance to divert 21st forces anywhere else.
		Under interrogation, General Homma reveals that Australia was nothing more than a diversion to make the Multinational Forces expend as much of their limited weaponry as possible.
		Japanese survivors are executed under Multinational Force Sanction Four.
		The French stealth ship Dessaix, presumed lost, was found by the Germans off the Canary Islands a few weeks after the initial Transition, and it now spearheads the assault on Yamamoto's real target: Hawaii.
		The ship's cruise missiles lay waste to the islands' defenses (and one nearly obliterates the city of Honolulu), although a French crew member manages to sabotage several of them before being killed.
		With the American defense crippled, the Japanese easily take Oahu and send a message to WashingtonC.
		stating that any attempt to retake the islands will result in the wholesale slaughter of the population.
		In Britain, preparations are underway for a commando raid on Norway against the heavy water plant there (a la Heroes of Telemark).
		But, information from Wehrmacht Colonel Paul Brasch (whose physically disabled son is eligible for 'disposal' under the T4 program) reveals that Germany's true nuclear effort lies elsewhere, and the mission is placed on hold.
		Operation Sea Dragon commences the next day with an attempt to invade across the English Channel.
		Hundreds of aircraft and warships, upgraded with new technology, duel in the waters and skies south of England; the 21st century ship HMS Trident, more valuable as a command and control center than as a weapon, ensures that key German formations identified by Brasch are destroyed.
		Three missiles taken off the Dessaix are launched at British targets, but suspected sabotage causes two to crash harmlessly into the North Sea.
		The third does hit Biggin Hill airfield, but its primary warhead does not detonate.
		Despite heavy losses sustained by the RAF and the damage to Biggin Hill, the Germans lose most of their navy.
		Any airborne units that reach England are quickly isolated and crushed by the Allies.
		In the United States, a series of German-instigated bombings and race riots take place, targeting civilians for maximum effect.
		Wahabi and Baathist insurgents foment revolt across the Middle East and the Soviet Union, with enough time to train and equip its armies, has begun seizing the Afghan passes leading to India.
		Unbeknownst to either the Allies or Axis, the HMS Vanguard materialized on the Siberian ice pack (one day before the other ships) and is now providing the Soviets with invaluable resources and information.
		Stalin has also impounded the ships of Convoy PQ-17 and has his own atomic bomb program in place; it may take a decade of fighting, but Stalin will see nothing but global triumph for Communism.
		As the German forces retreat from the Channel, a group of SS commandos led by Otto Skorzeny attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Churchill (a la The Eagle Has Landed).
		They are thwarted by SAS Major Windsor, but Skorzeny escapes in the melee.
		Drone coverage over Oahu reveals that the Japanese are slaughtering military prisoners in droves.
		With the supercarrier Hillary Clinton all but useless in a fight, the 21st-century Japanese cruiser Siranui (crewed by survivors of the Leyte Gulf) prepares to lead the Allied forces in what will be a very bloody retaking of the Hawaiian Islands.

Naturally, Bashir suspects that Sloan wants Koval killed in a way that makes it look
	Such as, come across, confront
 like the Romulan's illness took a turn for the worse
	Much as in Hunters of Dune, where: 
		For three years, the no-ship (named the Ithaca by its passengers) has been in an alternate universe, carrying the gholas of Duncan Idaho and the famous military commander Miles Teg as well as the Bene Gesserit Sheeana, who has the mysterious power to control sandworms.
		Other passengers include the last Bene Tleilax Master Scytale, some Bene Gesserits, a group of Jews saved from Honored Matre oppression on the planet Gammu, seven small sandworms that can produce spice, and four captive Futars, fierce half-man/half-cat creatures bred to hunt Honored Matres.
		The mysterious Oracle of Time speaks to Duncan and brings the no-ship back into the 'regular' universe.
		However, it is soon discovered by the mysterious "old man and old woman", Daniel and Marty, first mentioned at the end of Chapterhouse Dune, who have unknown designs on the Ithaca and its passengers.
		The no-ship is nearly caught in their tachyon net, but escapes using the space-folding Holtzman engines.
		Meanwhile, Murbella is trying to prevent civil war on Chapterhouse, the only known source of melange left in the universe.
		She meets an emissary sent by the Spacing Guild, which is desperate for spice.
		Murbella refuses their requests due to the help the Guild gave to the Honored Matres, and demands the Guild's future loyalty, threatening to cut them off completely.
		Unbeknownst to the Guild delegation and the rest of the universe, the sandworms on Chapterhouse are not yet producing much melange; the Bene Gesserit are making it seem so, using their own stockpiles.
		Later, Murbella stops a brutal fight between some polarized Bene Gesserits and Honored Matres.
		Though the Honored Matres had destroyed all Bene Tleilax worlds, their descendants (the Lost Tleilaxu) have returned from The Scattering.
		Supposedly under their complete control are their improved Face Dancers, creatures who can mimic other humans exactly and go undetected by all known means.
		It is soon revealed that the Face Dancers have their own will and motives, as they kill the Tleilaxu Elder Burah and replace him with their own duplicate.
		They have now replaced all the Lost Tleilaxu Elders, as well as countless humans on various planets in the Old Empire.
		Their leader Khrone sends the scribe Uxtal (presumably the highest-ranking, if only, Lost Tleilaxu left alive) to serve the renegade Honored Matre leader Hellica, who has proclaimed herself Matre Superior and now rules the conquered Bene Tleilax homeworld, Tleilax.
		The desperate Spacing Guild Administrators go to Ix to find an alternative to the use of their own Navigators (who require spice) for space travel.
		Unbeknownst to the Ixians or the Guild, Khrone and his Face Dancers have infiltrated Ix.
		While carefully executing his own plans for Face Dancer domination of the universe, Khrone is doing the bidding of Daniel and Marty by offering their advanced navigation technology to the Guild as if it were of Ixian design.
		The Guild agrees to the development of this technology if they have a monopoly on it.
		Uxtal has been forced to use Tleilaxu axlotl tank technology to produce the adrenaline-enhancing drug used by Honored Matres.
		Khrone also tasks Uxtal to make a ghola from recently found cell samples, which turn out to be those of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.
		From the start, the young Baron is as sociopathic as the original.
		Later, Khrone obtains the blood of Paul Atreides from a religious relic on the Atreides homeworld once known as Caladan, and has Uxtal make a ghola of Paul.
		He plans to twist this Kwisatz Haderach ghola (using the Baron Harkonnen ghola) into a weapon for Daniel and Marty's conquest of the universe.
		Later, the Guild Navigator Edrik comes to Tleilax seeking Uxtal's knowledge of axlotl tanks; the Navigator fears his kind's obsolescence when the Ixian navigation technology becomes available.
		He seeks an alternate source of spice to break the Bene Gesserit monopoly, but even Uxtal believes that secret has died with the Tleilaxu Masters murdered by the Honored Matres.
		Eventually he is able to access the genetic material of deceased Master Waff, and through an accelerated process creates several (ultimately flawed) Waff gholas, hoping to unlock the secret of producing melange in the tanks.
		The entire universe is unaware that in the events of Chapterhouse Dune, Scytale had been forced to give the passengers of the Ithaca the secret, and it was in use on the no-ship as their primary source of spice.
		The Tleilaxu had always sustained their lives indefinitely through the use of gholas; now Scytale's current body is slowly dying, and he does not have another to replace it.
		Needing to grow a new ghola of himself, he has only one secret to use as a bargaining tool: a hidden nullentropy capsule containing cells carefully and secretly collected by the Tleilaxu for millennia, including the cells of Tleilaxu Masters, Face Dancers, Paul Atreides, Duke Leto Atreides, Lady Jessica, Chani, Stilgar, Leto Atreides II, Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and even legendary figures dating back to the Butlerian Jihad, including Serena Butler and Xavier Harkonnen.
		The Bene Gesserit have a vicious debate over whether to create gholas of any of these historical figures.
		Sheeana believes they may prove useful, while others fear the return of such 'mistakes' as Leto II.
		Despite the controversy, gholas are created, a few at a time.
		Scytale is allowed to have his own once the first few have been born.
		On Chapterhouse, Murbella trains an elite strike force of Bene Gesserit using the combined skills of Bene Gesserits, Honored Matres, and 'lost' Swordmasters of the Ginaz.
		Her 'Valkyries' attack the rebel Honored Matre strongholds on other planets with success, in the process discovering that some of the Honored Matres are Face Dancers in disguise, undetectable until death.
		A former Honored Matre herself, Murbella eventually accesses the Other Memory from her Honored Matre ancestors, and learns their true origins.
		The core of the Honored Matres were vengeful Tleilaxu females, freed and assimilated by Fish Speakers and Bene Gesserits fleeing in The Scattering.
		The Tleilaxu women had been used as axlotl tanks by their males for millennia; though the current Honored Matres did not know their own origins, this explains to Murbella why they had been compelled to so mercilessly annihilate the Tleilaxu worlds in the Old Empire.
		Murbella also 'remembers' the attack by a renegade Honored Matre that first antagonized the Enemy.
		On the no-ship, an attempt by rebel Bene Gesserits to murder the Leto II ghola is foiled by the child himself, seemingly able to change into a sandworm at will.
		The Paul ghola wants to remember his past; with the help of the Chani ghola, he steals and consumes an overdose of spice.
		This fails to awaken his past memories, but instead he has a vision in which he has been stabbed by another, evil Paul Atreides.
		After being discovered by the Bene Gesserit, he concludes that it is prescience.
		Sheanna s own visions bring a warning from the legendary Reverend Mother Ramallo of Arrakis about the use of the gholas.
		She stops the ghola program from continuing until she can make sense of it all.
		Daniel and Marty inform Khrone that they have no further need of his Baron Harkonnen and Paul Atreides gholas.
		They insist they have lured the Ithaca into a trap, and will soon have the Kwisatz Haderach they have calculated is on board.
		Khrone, however, continues to prepare the gholas.
		He finally manages to restore the Baron's memories, and instructs him to train the Paul ghola (named Paolo), who does not yet have his memories.
		To the Baron's disquiet, he finds the mocking voice of his granddaughter Alia in his thoughts soon after recovering his memories.
		She also later threatens him should he try to harm Paolo.
		Murbella contracts Ix's competitor Richese to provide as many armed ships, and as much weaponry, as possible, in preparation for the confrontation with the unknown enemy.
		Later, the Honored Matres destroy the entire planet of Richese to cripple the Sisterhood.
		In a final assault on Tleilax, the most powerful of the rebel Honored Matre strongholds, Murbella and her Valkyries are victorious.
		It is revealed that Matre Superior Hellica and several of her elite guard were, in fact, Face Dancers.
		Many of the surviving Honored Matres then join with Murbella.
		Uxtal and the sole remaining Waff ghola each attempt to escape during the chaos.
		A Tleilaxu farmer gleefully allows "Master" Uxtal to be devoured by hungry sligs, while Waff finds refuge with the Spacing Guild, offering Edrik something better than artificial melange the genetic knowledge for the Guild to create their own, optimized sandworms.
		The Ithaca stumbles upon the homeworld of the Handlers, masters of the Futars.
		An exploratory party from the no-ship returns the man-beasts, and soon discovers that the seemingly bucolic Handlers are actually Face Dancers, tasked with their capture.
		Sheanna and her companions barely escape with their lives.
		Some Face Dancer ships manage to crash into the Ithaca before its escape, and potentially missing bodies in the wreckage have the no-ship's passengers wondering if the enemies are now among them.
		The emergency forces Miles Teg to reveal his hidden power of superhuman speed, unlocked in him during torture by Honored Matres in Heretics of Dune.
		He has kept this ability secret because the Bene Gesserit are suspicious of any males having any "wild talents", lest another Kwisatz Haderach be created.
		To them, Paul Atreides and Leto II were disasters never to be repeated.
		Murbella, now in complete control of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit, prepares a defense against the forces of the Enemy, now identified by Other Memory to be thinking machines of Omnius, the machine overlord destroyed back in the ancient Butlerian Jihad.
		The Oracle of Time is then revealed to be the living consciousness of Norma Cenva, somehow also still in existence millennia after the Jihad.
		The story concludes with Daniel and Marty revealed to be Omnius and the independent robot, Erasmus.
		Before its destruction, the Omnius incarnation on Giedi Prime had launched 5,000 probes capable of constructing new machine colonies on any planets encountered.
		One of these probes eventually intercepted a signal transmitted by the last remaining Omnius on Corrin before it too was destroyed.
		Its forces and Synchronized Empire finally reassembled, the new version of the Evermind is on the way back to the Old Empire to destroy all humanity.

		Police intervene and Aochi vouches for his friend, preventing his arrest.
		The two catch up over dinner where they are entertained by and become smitten with the mourning geisha Koine.
		Six months later, Aochi visits his friend and is shocked to find that he has settled down and is having a child with Sono, a woman who bears a remarkable resemblance to Koine.

		Meenakshi (Bhanupriya) and Savitri (Devilalita) are daughters of a Kuchipudi doyen, Seshendra Shastry.
		While a highly accomplished artist in his field, Seshendra Shastry is not well-off and has not been able to afford his daughters a conventional education.
		Both of them have achieved a respectable degree of proficiency   Savitri in Carnatic classical music and Meenakshi in classical dance.
		Savitri is grateful for her knowledge and interest and looks forward to a life that will require her to hone her skills in the same art.
		Meenakshi, on the other hand, is bitter about the lack of opportunity that she feels in the field of classical dance in India and resolves to make a simpler and more pleasurable life for herself as soon as possible, while confiding her ambitions only to her sister.
		Chandrasekhar (Venkatesh) is a tenant who has just moved in next door.
		He is a painter and is shown to be handling movie promotions as a large chunk of his work.
		He develops an interest in the neighbors and tries to help them in whatever way he can, partly because of his (unconfessed) interest in Meenakshi and partly because of his interest in the art which seems to be slowly fading away from public life.
		The rest of the film is largely built around Meenakshi's journey from skepticism to devotion in her pursuit of dance.
		Chandrasekhar is shown to be an important catalyst in this transformation.
		Meenakshi becomes an accomplished dancer through the direction of renowned Odissi dancer Sharon Lowen, and gets an opportunity to go abroad and perform.
		She learns of Chandrasekhar's love for her.
		She doesn't go abroad and finally unites with Chandrasekhar, confessing her love for him as well.

Ross muses that Sloan could have an accomplice on Romulus to carry out the plan as they are both watching Sloan
	Much as in Blackberry Wine, where: 
		Writer Jay Mackintosh is suffering from writer's block.
		Having reached his artistic zenith with the award-winning 'Jackapple Joe', a novel published 10 years ago, he has failed to duplicate his earlier success, and now writes second-rate science-fiction novels under a pseudonym.
		He lives in London with his ambitious girlfriend, Kerry, and teaches creative writing to vapid young students whilst living on his dwindling reputation.
		Jackapple Joe, Jay's only best-seller, was a nostalgic retelling of Jay's childhood summers in the Yorkshire town of Kirby Monckton.
		It is a coming-of-age story, describing how Jay was befriended, following his parents' divorce, by an eccentric old man called Joseph Cox, a gardener, poet and everyday magician, with whom he was to forge a unique relationship.
		Blackberry Wine acquaints readers with Joe through flashbacks as, now aged 37 and feeling increasingly unfullfilled, Jay revisits his childhood haunts and discovers a box of Joe's "Specials", bottles of home-made wine that may hold the key to Joe's unexplained disappearance.
		Under the influence of this magical home-brew, Jay finds himself behaving in a more and more erratic way.
		He buys a house he has never seen in the French village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes and moves there, ostensibly to write, but in reality to escape from Kerry, the pressures of fame and the expectations of his public.
		The estate, Joe's bottles of homemade wine ("The Specials") and vivid memories of Joe that gradually become more than simply memories, inspire Jay to write again for the first time in a decade, and to rediscover what truly matters to him.
		He begins to write a new book about Lansquenet and its inhabitants, whilst secretly observing his neighbour, the reclusive Marise d'Api, whose land borders his own.
		This fiercely independent woman lives alone with her deaf daughter, and although she resists all Jay's attempts to get to know her, he becomes increasingly fascinated by her.
		After weeks of inspired writing, rewarding hard work in his gardens and revisiting the past through Joe's "Specials", Jay comes to feel that the life he is building for himself is more important than writing the great follow-up novel and that self-fulfilment is more alluring to him now than fame and notoriety.
		He finally gains Marise's confidence following a crisis at her farm, and learns the terrible secret that she has been so desperate to conceal.
		However, just as Jay is about to accept that he is falling in love with Marise, his ex-girlfriend Kerry arrives in Lansquenet, having gained access to Jay's whereabouts and the first pages of his new book.
		Determined to 'redeem' him (and recognising the book's potential) she prepares for a massive publicity stunt, that would reveal Jay's whereabouts to the press.
		This would re-launch Jay's flagging career; it would also mean that Lansquenet would suffer a damaging influx of tourists that might change the place forever.
		Jay is torn between his ambition and his growing realisation that he has managed to recapture in Lansquenet the simplicity and magic of his life with Joe, and that he cannot bear to lose it a second time.
		To put a stop to Kerry's machinations, Jay burns the sole manuscript of his book and, finally at peace with himself, prepares to begin a new life with Marise.

		After Van Buren discovers a blog site featuring video of an alarming amount of explosives, Detectives Lupo and Bernard race against time to find the anonymous blogger before he can make good on his threat to blow up a school.
		The Department of Education's refusal to take the threat seriously and resistance from the teachers' union further complicate the investigation.
		Fortunately, an administrative assistant at the teachers' union, Alicia (Lindsey Vonn), gives the detectives a tip to lead them in the right direction.
		Meanwhile, Van Buren struggles to keep her personal issues from becoming public.
		In the last scene of the episode, at a local bar Lupo and Bernard planned a debt party for Van Buren, where her colleagues get together in a bar to make contributions to help pay her medical bills.
		She arrives with Frank Gibson (Ernie Hudson) and they all applaud her.
		The Chief of Detectives provides a few checks for the collection jar.
		She introduces Frank as her boyfriend, but says as of that afternoon, he is her fianc .
		Van Buren's phone rings with a message; it is her doctor.
		She cries briefly after she gets off the phone, then composes herself, saying "thank you, thank you, thank you".
		She whispers into Frank's ear, and they embrace.
		Although the exact nature of the message is left ambiguous, it is implied from Van Buren's reaction that she has received good news about her cervical cancer, perhaps remission.
		The elements of the plot were inspired by an ongoing controversy surrounding New York City's policy and union rules for teachers in early 2010.

		Myrddin tells Gwyna to give Arthur Caliburn while pretending to be the Lady of the Lake.
		When she does that successfully, Myrddin disguises her in boy's clothes so that she can travel with the war-band as his servant.
		During her travels, she meets a boy who was brought up as a girl, tricks a holy man, swims in the Roman baths of Aquae Sulis, takes part in a battle, and witnesses Arthur's brutality, piety and immorality, all the while observing her master create the fantastic stories that have made 'King Arthur' one of the most famous men in legend.
		After Arthur's death she creates some stories herself, conceding that the legend is more important than the mere facts.

		At first glance the seventeen inhabitants of the old apartment building in Berlin Kreuzberg do not seem to have much in common other than their address.

		There is 60 year old Hannelore who dreams about distant countries and who currently shares her apartment with her lovesick niece, there is student Bona from the Ivory Coast who teaches French in the kitchen while his gay room mate enjoys life and love; the two adolescent sisters with their mother who has fallen in love recently, the middle aged married janitors and then there is the young couple whose daughter prefers sitting in the stairwell than going to school.

		He finally takes shelter in a derelict bombed-out building, where he stumbles across Chris Lloyd (Dirk Bogarde) and the body of the man Lloyd has just killed &ndash; his wife's employer, who Lloyd had discovered was having an affair with his wife.
		Now on the run, and aware that Robbie is the only witness to his crime, Lloyd realises that he will have to get out of London and that he has no option but to take the boy with him.
		The film follows the pair as they travel northwards towards Scotland with the police in somewhat baffled pursuit, and charts the developing relationship between the two.
		Initially Lloyd regards Robbie dismissively, as an unwanted inconvenience, while Robbie is wary and suspicious of Lloyd.
		As their journey progresses however, the pair gradually develop a strong bond of friendship, trust and common cause, with both feeling they have burned their bridges and now have nothing to lose.
		They finally reach a small Scottish fishing port, where Lloyd steals a boat and sets sail for Ireland.
		During the voyage Robbie falls seriously ill, and Lloyd turns the boat back towards Scotland, where he knows the police are waiting for him.

Enraged
	Much as in The Pale Criminal, where: 
		Set in 1938, two years after the events of March Violets, Bernhard (Bernie) G nther has taken Bruno Stahlecker, another ex-police officer, as his partner.
		The two are working on a case where a Frau Lange, owner of a large publishing house, is being blackmailed for the homosexual love letters her son Reinhardt sent to his psychotherapist dr Kindermann.
		G nther and Stahlecker discover the blackmailer to be Klaus Hering, a disgruntled employee of Kindermann.
		Bruno is killed during a stakeout at Hering's apartment, and shortly thereafter Hering is found hanging in the apartment.
		Around that time, G nther is summoned to the Gestapo offices by Arthur Nebe and there Reinhard Heydrich forces G nther to look for a serial sex murderer, who is killing blond and blue-eyed teenage girls in Berlin and making fools of the police.
		G nther has no choice but to accept the temporary post of Kriminalkommissar in Heydrich's state Security Service, with a team of policemen working underneath him.
		G nther and his team then follow a number of dead end leads: A Jewish man held on suspicion, Joseph Kahn, is determined to be too improbable a suspect by an expert on psychotherapy, and eventually let go; A violent sexual deviant, Gottfried Bautz, is captured but when an anonymous caller reveals the location of a fifth victim while he is in jail, he must also be let go.
		G nther and a colleague then make a trip to Nuremberg, where they plan to investigate publisher and government administrator Julius Streicher, whom they suspect might be connected to the murders because of the similarity between the imagery depicted in his newspaper Der St rmer and the murders.
		They have the well-known depravity of Streicher confirmed to them by the local police chief, but fail to formally connect him to the murders.
		While they are there, they also learn of the sixth murder and promptly return to Berlin.
		G nther and his team then focus their investigation on the family of the latest victim, Emmeline Steiniger, who lived along with her stepmother Hildegard.
		In the meantime another girl, Lisa Ganz, disappears.
		About two weeks later, a second anonymous tip leads to the discovery of her body.
		When G nther interrogates the Ganz parents, they act strangely and eventually reveal they had hired a private detective, Rolf Vogelmann, to help them find their daughter.
		Vogelmann is known by name to G nther from his biweekly newspaper ads which, as G nther later finds out, are bankrolled by the Lange publishing house.
		Following up on his suspicion of Vogelmann, G nther teams up with Hildegard Steiniger and, pretending to be a couple, call on Vogelmann to hire him to help them find their daughter.
		A few days after the meeting, Vogelmann shows up with a dr Otto Rahn at Steiniger's apartment when G nther luckily happens to be there.
		Claiming his searches have yielded no clues, Vogelmann and Rahn encourage the Steinigers to attend a s ance as another option to try to find Emmeline.
		They accept, after which G nther learns that Rahn is in the SS.
		G nther and Steiniger keep up their deception and attend the s ance at the house of the medium, Karl Maria Weisthor.
		Also in attendance are Vogelmann, Heinrich Himmler, Reinhardt Lange, and dr Kindermann.
		During the s ance, Weisthor pretends to summon the spirit of Emmeline Steiniger and that it reveals its location.
		Afterward the "Steinigers" leave but G nther doubles back to investigate Weisthor's house.
		There he espies Weisthof, Rahn, and Kindermann, and hears them comment on how they set up the bogus s ance to control Himmler for political means, including to excite the population of Berlin against the Jews through propaganda to the effect that they must be responsible for the murders.
		He also discovers a series of letters confirming the plot mentioned by Weisthor and company as "Project Krist", and one letter convening many top-ranking SS officers to a "Court of Honour" at a castle in the village of Wewelsburg.
		As expected, Emmeline Steiniger's body is "discovered" a few days later.
		G nther picks up Reinhardt Lange and extracts a confession that reveals Kindermann and Rahn killed Stahlecker and confirms how he, Lange, funded Vogelmann as a device to recruit the parents of murder victims to s ances and give credibility to the depraved occultist apparatus of Weisthor, Kindermann, and Rahn.
		He then drives with Lange to Kindermann's clinic to retrieve the case file of Wiesthor as evidence.
		There, he finds Kindermann's files, including one describing Weisthor as a lunatic, one referring to Lange as a "neurotic effeminate" and, he is surprised to discover, a file on Inge Lorenz, to whom G nther was previously attached (see March Violets).
		When Kindermann shows up, a fight ensues in which Kindermann kills Lange, and G nther knocks Kindermann out.
		G nther then packs Kindermann in a car and heads out to Wewelsburg to attend the SS Court of Honor.
		Kindermann comes to in the car and arrogantly volunteers additional background information related to Project Krist.
		This way, G nther also learns that Kindermann was treating Inge Lorez for depression using cocaine and that she became addicted and eventually overdosed in his clinic.
		Further on the way to Wewelsburg, G nther stops the car, kills Kindermann in cold blood, and moves on.
		At the Court of Honor, G nther manages to explain everything to Heydrich, and eventually Weisthor and Rahn are exposed as criminals.
		Himmler, whose plan against the Jewish population has apparently failed, holds his peace after a brief outburst against G nther.

	Much as in The Year Without a Santa Claus (2006 film), where: 
		This remake follows the same basic concept as the original: Santa, disillusioned by children's lack of belief in him and in the spirit of giving, decides not to deliver toys this Christmas Eve, despite the arguments by mrs Claus and two of his helper-elves, Jingle and Jangle.
		They decide to provide Santa with some proof that children still believe and that they still deserve toys from Santa, so the elves visit the United States in search of Christmas spirit.
		They face setbacks both in South Town, which is celebrating its annual Winter Festival, and in their dealings with the jealous, competitive Miser Brothers, who refuse to compromise long enough to permit a Christmas snow in the southern town.
		Finally, Santa's faith in children is renewed with the help of the boy Iggy Thistlewhite.
		The most obvious differences are in the setting, which is moved to the 21st century present day, and the music, which is all but gone.
		Only the iconic "Miser" songs are retained (though they are mixed together and instead of being sung when the Misers are approached, the song is sung during their feud).
		The remake also includes two subplots which do not appear in the original: The commercial coup of Santa's toy-making operation by the ambitious elf Sparky, who wants a more modern and lucrative approach; and the family troubles of Iggy.
		His father (here, the mayor) is too busy to focus on his family, even at Christmas.
		Mayor Thistlewhite is a foil both for Santa, in his journey to rediscover the Christmas spirit, and for Sparky, in his efforts to sell out the town's historic district to an out-of-town commercial enterprise.
		In addition, the movie attempts to give more depth to the relationship between mrs Claus and Santa.
		Another difference is that it is Santa who sees the Miser Brothers about having it snow in South Town instead of mrs Claus.
		Like in the original, the brothers refuse to cooperate, but change their minds when Santa threatens to go to their mother.
		A number of pop-culture references pepper the script, including a glimpse of the original Year without a Santa Claus special on Jangle's portable TV.
		Faced with the prospect of losing his job because of Santa's retirement, Jangle muses that he could go to work for his cousin, who is a dentist; this refers to Hermey in Rankin-Bass' Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
		The script also works in a reference to A Christmas Story: When a disgruntled marksman tells Santa he wanted a gun last Christmas, Santa flatly remarks, "You would've shot your eye out, kid.
		" Then he comically mimics the marksman having (hypothetically) done just that.

		Upon arrival, the boys find the village afflicted by plague, with piles of rotting animal corpses dominating the atmosphere.
		Soon after the boys' arrival, the villagers flee from the plague to a neighboring village, barricading the boys in and abandoning them to their fate.
		The group is joined (in stages) by a Korean boy named Li, a deserter from the army, and a young girl who has been abandoned in a warehouse.
		The boys attempt to make the most of their situation; Li teaches them to hunt birds, resulting in a jubilant festival, and the narrator finds love with the young girl.
		Their situation turns after a few days, however; the girl dies of plague after being bitten by a village dog, the narrator's brother runs away into the wild forest (and presumed dead), and the villagers eventually return and are furious with the state in which they find the village.
		Fearful of the repercussions should it become known that they abandoned the boys to die, they stab the deserter and alternately threaten the boys with violence and ply them with food.
		All members of the reformatory boys eventually agree to keep silent about the actions of the villagers, with the exception of the narrator.
		At the close of the novel, he is chased into the forest by the villagers to an unknown fate.

	Much as in An Accidental Man, where: 
		The novel is set in London.
		The plot involves a large number of characters who are related to each other by family or acquaintance.
		The "accidental man" of the title is Austin Gibson Grey, a middle-aged man who has lost his job and is living apart from his mentally fragile second wife Dorina.
		Austin's older brother, Sir Matthew Gibson Grey, has returned to London after a successful diplomatic career.
		The two brothers have been estranged for many years.
		Austin blames his brother for having injured him when they were children, leaving him with a deformed right hand, and for having had an affair with his first wife, both of which accusations Matthew denies.
		Matthew tries to reconcile with his brother, whose actions and accidents drive much of the plot.
		The novel begins with the engagement of Ludwig Leferrier, a young American historian, to Gracie, the daughter of George and Clara Tisbourne.
		Ludwig has decided to remain in England after a scholarship year in Oxford, rather than return to the United States.
		He is opposed to the Vietnam War and expects to be arrested for having avoided the draft if he goes home.
		Ludwig gets a job teaching at an Oxford college.
		Gracie's wealthy grandmother dies and leaves all her property to Gracie, despite the fact that her daughter Charlotte, Clara's sister, had lived with her and looked after her during her illness.
		During the course of the novel Ludwig begins to question his relationship with Gracie, who does not share his intellectual and moral seriousness, and who discourages him from trying to help Dorina and Charlotte.
		He also doubts his own motivation for staying in England.
		Other important characters include Austin's son Garth, who had been Ludwig's friend as a student at Harvard, and who also returns to London at the outset of the novel; Dorina's sister (and Matthew's lover) Mavis, a social worker who has lost her religious faith; and Mitzi Ricardo, a former star athlete whose career was ended by a freak accident and who works as a typist.
		Austin, with whom she is unrequitedly in love, rents a room in Mitzi's house.
		Austin, driving Matthew's car while drunk, hits and kills a child.
		With Matthew's help, Austin manages to escape police suspicion, but the child's father starts blackmailing him.
		In an altercation in Austin's room Austin hits him on the head, apparently killing him, and calls on Matthew, who helps him to make the death look like an accident before calling the police.
		In fact, the man is not dead, but suffers brain damage and memory loss, so the crime is undetected.
		Both Mitzi and Charlotte attempt suicide by taking overdoses of sleeping pills, but both are rescued in time and are taken to recover in the same hospital ward.
		They end up living together in a cottage in the country.
		Austin's wife Dorina, having left Mavis's house where she had been staying, goes into hiding in a hotel, where she dies accidentally when an electric heater falls into her bathtub.
		Shortly before her death she and Ludwig had seen each other in the street, but ignored each other.
		Ludwig is remorseful about his failure to approach her and feels that his reticence may have contributed to her death.
		Ludwig decides to break off his engagement with Gracie and return home, where he may be drafted or arrested.
		At the end of the novel he is on his way to the United States, accompanied by Matthew, who had helped him make the decision to go back.
		Garth, who has become a successful novelist, marries Gracie, while Austin starts a new relationship with his brother's abandoned lover Mavis.

		The bent objects include Professor Farnsworth, who is bent forward at a right angle so he always faces the ground.
		Offering to fix the Professor, Bender bends Farnsworth backward at a right angle.
		The crew plays the security tape from the night before, which shows Bender "sleep-bending".
		The Professor sends Bender away to satisfy his psychological need for bending; throughout the episode, the Professor annoys the rest of the crew with his uplifting personality and fascination of looking up at the sky now that he is bent backwards.
		Bender gets hired at a bending plant as a scab worker during a strike, and discovers that Flexo, who was sent to prison in Bender's place in a previous episode, is also employed as a scab.
		Also working at the factory is a buxom blue-collar beauty of a fembot named Angleyne.
		Bender quickly develops an affection for Angleyne, and they begin dating.
		Their relationship goes well, until Bender discovers that Angleyne and Flexo are a divorced couple on friendly terms, and that they may still be affectionate.
		In an attempt to discover Angleyne's true feelings, Bender disguises himself as Flexo, and meets her at an orbital nightclub.
		While there, Bender flashes the wad of cash he has made as a strikebreaker, which angers the members of the Robot Mafia who are present.
		Bender (as Flexo) succeeds in seducing Angleyne, but when she discovers his identity, Bender rushes off to kill Flexo.
		Bender arrives at the bending plant where Flexo is working the night shift, and starts a fight.
		Meanwhile in the crane control booth, the Robot Mafia moves an unbendable girder into position above Bender and Flexo.
		Because they do not know that Bender was disguised as Flexo, the Robot Mafia wants Flexo dead for Bender's monetary indiscretions.
		The girder is dropped on top of Flexo, crushing him.
		Angleyne confesses that she still loves Flexo, and Bender decides that her happiness is more important than his, and resolves to save Flexo by bending the unbendable girder.
		After a mighty struggle, he frees Flexo, earning Angleyne's appreciation, but not her love.
		Having satisfied his need for bending, Bender returns to his job at Planet Express.

		At the office of doctor Steven Price, the beast appears and kills a few men.

		It works, and the beast flees the building.
		The body of Drago's girl gets discovered and taken to Price; Jamie, suspecting Drago, goes out on his dirt bike and beats him.
		Soon after, Cinder and his deputy Lisa discover a mutilated corpse, and the beast shows up.
		Lisa and Cinder make their escape, and the sheriff injures his leg in the process.
		Lisa takes him to her house to heal, and they have sex.
		Meanwhile, Wicker and Mary Jane have gotten very drunk.
		Price is sent to watch over them until they can be evacuated.
		However, the beast gets past Price and kills Mary Jane in the basement.
		Her screams wake Wicker, and the beast rips his head off when he investigates.
		Cinder arrives afterwards, and Jamie suggests electrocuting the beast with a high-voltage coil from the local power plant.
		Price, thinking back to his success with the electrical trap, supports this course of action, and the sheriff drives out to the power plant with his men.
		There, Drago assaults Ruth and Cinder, but is stopped when Jamie shoots him with a shotgun.
		Cinder and his crew return to Wicker's house and begin setting up their trap, laying metal wire between the trees and connecting it to the coil, which will discharge when they throw the circuit breakers.
		The beast takes them by surprise, and Jamie must hold onto the wire to keep it inside the trap.
		They throw the breakers, and the surge makes the beast explode, and takes Jamie with it as well.

		In the 16th century,(In Ming Dynasty Era) Japanese pirates terrorized the harbors of China for decades until General Chi Ching Kwong (Ti Lung) masterminded a naval task force to combat the invaders.
		The oppressive Japanese government sends a contingent of stealth Ninjas to assassinate the General in his palace.
		His son discovers that these killers have pledged their lives to eradicate his father.
		Soon Ninja assassins are attacking the General s soldiers in order to get to him.
		General Chi Ching Kwong sends his son on a mission to recruit three Chinese anti-Ninjitsu fighters from the elder Master of Three Arts, who owes the General a debt.
		When the son establishes contact with the Master of Three Arts, the old one informs the General s son that his three pupils do not know each other s identity.
		The General s son first meets up with the mischievous Chow Chun (Chiang Sheng) who he quickly enlists to the cause.
		Together they recruit the other student, a blacksmith named Tung Yen (Lu Feng).
		Chow Chun and Tung Yen are students of the same master, but don t know each other and their philosophies cause them to fight playfully.
		Finally, the contingent adds the missing component to their team, that of weapons specialist, Mao Tin Yeung (Phil Kwok).
		Even as General Chi Ching Kwong s son and his newfound allies return to the palace, several Ninjas have infiltrated the household disguised as servants.
		The General s son then assigns each of his fighters to pose as servants as well, to catch any possible assassination attempts.
		Chow Chun is assigned to assist in the kitchens, to watch over the staff.
		He sees the lead cook load a deadly blade onto a tray and try to deliver it to the General for dinner.

		Rev.
		Biggs' secretary, Beverly (Loretta Devine), becomes comically defensive and aggressive, believing Dudley is there to take her job.

	Much as in Taking Lives (film), where: 
		The film opens in early 1980s Canada where teenager Martin Asher (Paul Dano) is seen ambling about a bus station, seemingly uncertain of his destination.
		He befriends another teen on the bus, Matt Soulsby (Justin Chatwin) and the two talk about their plans for the future.
		When their bus breaks down, the two acquire a car from a nearby garage.
		While Martin is driving, a tire blows.
		Matt struggles to change the tire and Martin comments on how he and Matt are both about the same height, and kicks Matt into the path of an oncoming truck.
		He is last seen toting Matt's guitar and walking away singing in a voice similar to Matt's.
		Twenty years later, a successful FBI profiler, Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie), is summoned to help out Canadian law enforcement in Montreal, to apprehend Asher, who has been killing people for years and assuming their identities as he travels across North America.
		Scott has to adjust to working in a strange city with a police team that she does not really fit in with.
		On a ferry to Quebec City, Martin's mother (Gena Rowlands) recognizes her son.
		After docking she locates a police officer and tells him that she saw her son on the ferry.
		Upon telling the officer her son died 19 years ago, she discusses the matter with a city official.
		She is convinced the man she saw was her son, and exclaims to the officer that her son is "dangerous".
		Based on mrs Asher's statement, the body believed to be that of her son is exhumed for an autopsy.
		The team meets with art salesman James Costa (Ethan Hawke), an eyewitness who saw Asher kill his last victim.
		Costa makes a drawing of Asher and, within a couple of days, Asher's apartment is found.
		Scott discovers Asher's next target is Costa, so protecting him is priority number one.
		During the time they spend together, Scott and Costa begin to develop feelings for each other, though Scott refuses to become involved with him because of the ongoing case.
		Asher flees with Costa as a hostage and Scott pursues them.
		Scott sees Asher die in a car accident and the case is closed.
		As Scott is packing up, preparing to return home, Costa visits her in her hotel room.
		Without saying anything, he undresses her and they make passionate love on a chest of drawers and the bed, surrounded by gruesome crime scene photos.
		The next morning, Scott awakes to find herself partly covered in Costa's blood.
		At first, she fears he is dead, but then he awakes and they discover he had merely popped the stitches in his arm that he received after the auto accident.
		As Costa's stitches are repaired in the hospital, Scott is called down to the morgue as mrs Asher has come to identify the burned body of her son, killed in the accident.
		She says the body is not her son.
		mrs Asher and Scott realize that Asher is still alive.

		Before Scott can reach her, the elevator door closes.
		Scott descends the stairs, hoping to intercept mrs Asher on the ground floor.
		When the elevator door opens, Scott sees Costa covered in blood, having killed mrs Asher - who Scott realizes is Costa's mother.
		The police try to capture Asher who escapes the hospital.
		Scott returns to her hotel room and frantically washes herself, in a state of manic disgust.
		An investigation shows that the man who died in the car accident, who the real Asher had identified as Asher, was actually Christopher Hart (Kiefer Sutherland), a drug dealer and art thief to whom Asher owed $80,000, and whom Asher murdered.
		The Montreal police chase Asher, but he escapes in a train station and boards a train headed east of Montreal, meanwhile setting up his next victim, a sports talent scout.
		After that, he calls Scott on the phone and taunts her.
		Scott admits to having consensual sex with Asher, and is consequently fired from the FBI.
		Seven months later, Scott is living in an desolate farmhouse by herself in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and looking heavily pregnant with Asher's twin boys.
		One day as she sits alone in her home, she discovers Asher has broken into her house.
		She frantically tries to escape, but Asher quickly overpowers her and then reveals he has found all the guns she had hidden throughout the house.
		Asher makes her tea and tells her they could start over and live together as a family, but a disgusted Scott tells him she does not want to.
		Enraged, Asher begins beating and choking her and eventually stabs her in her belly with a pair of scissors.
		Scott, seemingly unharmed by the stabbing, shocks Asher by quickly stabbing him in the heart with the same scissors.
		As Asher is on his knees looking at her in disbelief, Scott removes a prosthetic pregnant belly, and tells him the past seven months have been a carefully planned trap.
		He falls over, dead.

		The story is set in a strange world where two floating islands named Yulgaha and Yanuess slowly move through the sky.
		The people on the ground named these islands " dens", and they control all the land.
		A boy, Yorn, was born on Yulgaha, but in his infancy, he was separated from his mother and brought to live on the surface.
		Although the foster father that raised him was poor, Yorn grew into a bright, chipper young man.
		One day, Yorn is attacked by Hairra, a woman who is later revealed to be a puppet from Yulgaha, while he is forging a sword.
		When she breaks the sword and attempts to kill him, his father sacrifices himself to save Yorn.
		Hairra proceeds to incapacitate Yorn, but is prevented from killing him by the arrival of a mysterious young girl.
		The girl picks up the hilt of Yorn's sword and drives it into her hand, magically transforming it into the sword of the God hunter.
		Hairra attempts to kill her, but she transforms into a young woman armed with a staff (Seeda) and fights back.
		During this battle, Yorn's powers as a God-Hunter are awakened by the sword and he enters the battle.
		Using a massive energy blast emanating from the sword, he drives off Hairra and her brother.
		During the interim, the mysterious girl disappears.
		She rejoins him later when both are caught by the Chosen of Yulgaha for drinking from a desert oasis that was sacred to Yulgaha, and after a series of events they and the old man Yorn met after the conflict with Hairra set off for Rubeet.
		They come to a village that is being attacked by a white leopard.
		The young girl wanders off into the forest after a dance that told the story of the God Hunter.
		Searching for her, Yorn, the old man and some of the villagers go into the forest to search for her.
		They find her (caught in a trap that had been meant for the leopard), but shortly after that the white leopard attacks.
		It attacks the village chief but is driven off by the old man.
		It finds Yorn and the young girl, but does not attack.
		The young girl follows it, and when Yorn gets back the strength to search for her, he overhears her talking to someone.
		As he follows the voice of the girl to its source, he finds her name is Elisiss.
		When he finds her, it turns out that she had been talking to the leopard.
		He puts himself between the two, but Elisiss then puts herself between him and the leopard, protecting it.
		Shortly after that, the leopard is attacked by someone who looks similar to Yorn.
		Elisiss again interposes herself between the leopard and its assailant, but he is only stopped when Yorn parries his blade.
		He is stronger than Yorn, however, and knocks his sword out of his hands and to the ground.
		He spares Yorn however, and introduces himself as Spike Randit, another God Hunter, before leaving.
		While Yorn is trying reconcile the fact that he is a God Hunter with himself, not quite able to believe it, Elisiss licks his wound.
		This somehow heals it, and prompts a bit of teasing from the old man.
		Afterwards, when the talk turns to the white leopard, Elisiss tells them it is her sister and will not be seen in the forest again.

		In Las Vegas, vice LVMPD policemen Vincent Downs and Sean Cass rob a shipment of cocaine belonging to entrepreneur Stanley Rubino, who is associated with mobster Rob Novak, the son of a powerful mob boss.
		They volunteer to investigate the robbery in order to cover up their involvement, clashing with Internal Affairs investigators Jennifer Bryant and Doug Dennison, who are suspicious of their involvement.
		Unbeknownst to them, Vincent is undercover on behalf of Internal Affairs to dismantle the crime ring within the police department, which has left him estranged from his ex-wife Dena and their son, Thomas.
		While driving Thomas to soccer practice, Vincent is ambushed by Rubino's men, who stab him in the abdomen and kidnap Thomas, demanding the stolen cocaine back in exchange for Thomas's life.
		Vincent retrieves the cocaine from Cass, places it in a duffel bag and leaves it in the ventilation shaft of one of the bathrooms in Rubino's casino, but is unknowingly followed by Bryant, who hides it in the women's locker room nearby.
		Upon learning that the drugs were moved, Vincent is forced to present Rubino with a bag of sugar to ensure Thomas's safety, but Novak uncovers his ruse and Thomas is recaptured by Rubino's men, while Vincent manages to escape.
		Vincent infiltrates the casino disguised as a security guard, but is located by Bryant and chased into one of the hotel rooms, where he subdues her and reveals he's working for Internal Affairs.
		Bryant directs him to the locker room, but the drugs have disappeared.

		Cass arrives and saves Vincent from Novak's men, but is shot in the process and presumed dead.

		Jan Levinson-Gould (Melora Hardin) tasks Michael Scott (Steve Carell) with picking a new healthcare plan for the office, dictating that he must choose a provider and simply pick the cheapest plan.
		Unwilling to reveal the bad news that healthcare benefits will likely be cut to the employees, Michael at first tasks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) with handling the healthcare decision, but Jim instead recommends Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who eagerly accepts the assignment.
		To work on the plan, Michael allows Dwight to use the conference room as a temporary workspace, though Dwight lets the power go to his head and refers to his workspace as an office.
		Dwight picks a very cheap plan, with little coverage, no benefits and a large deductible.
		Not willing to confront the disgruntled employees, Michael hides out in his office claiming he is very busy.
		When the other confront him about Dwight's bad plan, he chastises Dwight and tries to liven the employees' spirits by telling them he has a big surprise prepared for them at the end of the day, though even he isn't sure what the surprise will be.

On
	Much as in Kalloori, where: 
		The film begins with group of students clearing weeds near a roadside tree.
		The scene flashes back a few years earlier in a bus with a lot of college students heading towards Government Arts College in a small town.
		A set &mdash; Muthuchelvan, Ramesh, Kayalvizhi, Adhilakshmi, Nagarani, Albert, Kaamatchinathan, Salima, Iyanar &mdash; are introduced as friends since high school.
		There is a small build up to the introduction of the hero (Muthu played by newcomer Akil), who is part and parcel of the circle,a well talented athlete; Ramesh- a big flirt and movie buff; Kayalvizhi- a strong willed and courageous woman who hates the ideas of falling in love within friends; Adhilakshmi- a food lover; Nagarani- a Telugu speaking girl who gets fits when she got frightened up;Albert- a Christian, always get abused by his drunkard father; Kaamatchinathan- a rich,yet timid person who even gets very shy to introduce himself to his classmates at the first day of college; Salima- A Muslim girl and very intelligent in both studies and talented in dance and Iyanar- a quirky guy.
		All are studying in the same class.
		They enter into the college for the first time.
		In the classroom they see a beautiful girl Shobhana (played by Tamannaah), who is strikingly different.
		She looks depressed and sad and aloof.
		The friends are puzzled by her in the beginning and later they learn she lost her mom recently in an accident.
		The group sympathizes for her and brings her into its fold.
		Shobhana soon becomes a member of their group and ditches her plans to pursue her course in Delhi.
		She simply does it to be with these friends during college.
		Muthu who initially had a crush on Shobhana later abandons the feeling due to the respect of the friendship they have developed among their group.
		The movie goes on to narrate the college life with fun and colour.
		It shows the strength of the friendship and the backgrounds of the friends; most of them are from poor families.
		Muthu has an aim in his life.
		Being an athlete, he wants to excel in sports and get a good job through sports quota to give his poor family a new lease of life.
		Shobhana, who is from a wealthy family background, feels sympathy for Muthu after she sees the conditions he and his family lives in and is really moved by his perseverance and helps him achieve his goal by encouraging him in every chance.
		In fact as true friend many do the same and so does Shobhana.
		She even advises him that there is more he has to and capable of achieving in life so he should take her encouragements as a way to improve his career and nothing else.
		But eventually her encouraging stance turns into some sort of special attachment with him.
		Slowly love develops in the minds of both but they chose to put it on the back seat for the sake of the larger friendship they share with the group.
		In fact the poor lovers don t even share their feelings.
		Eventually they take a college trip to Andhra.
		On the way, they stop at a hotel but there is only non-vegetarian food being served so Muthu volunteers to run to the nearest vegetarian restaurant a few km away to bring food for Shobhana who is a vegetarian.
		Shobhana confessed her love for Muthu to Kayalvizhi which she accepts it wholeheartedly and says that even though she hate the concept of love between best friends, she don't want to spoil Shobhana's happiness and true love.
		This conversation was overheard by Adhilakshmi.
		The latter says this to the rest of the gang, to their surprise and delight.
		But fate has other plans,the hotel they were initially eating at is urgently closed because some politician or another has died.
		The group board the bus urgently and try to go to a collector's office or police station to keep safe while two classmates wait for Muthu to come back.
		On the way however, the bus is stopped by the protestors and despite pleas to allow them to pass, the protestors light the bus on fire.
		In a frenzy, everyone tries to evacuate the bus and Nagarani gets fits and has an attack.
		In a scramble to safely get off to bus, the rest of the group fail to realize that some students are still trapped.
		After the fire trucks finish putting out the fire, they bring out the burnt bodies of Kayal, Adhilakshmi and Shobhana, who have embraced each other in their final moments together-Kayal having stayed back to help Shobhana who's chudi had gotten caught in the bus.
		The last scene flashes back to the beginning of the movie where a group of people are clearing the weeds.
		It has been eight years since the incident and every year the group of friends come to pay respects to their lost friends and Muthu still keeps the handkerchief of Shobhana's in the remembrance of their love.

		He brings to the special house a turtle, a rabbit, a giant, a dead mouse (in a box, according to the illustration), monkeys, and "some skunkeys and a very old lion".
		The lion proceeds to eat all the stuffing from the "chairs chairs chairs".
		The boy plays with the creatures "making secrets" and laughing and running and pretending to be chickens and singing until the play becomes frantic and tumultuous and "nobody says stop stop stop".
		The boy describes how his house is not really anywhere but "root in the moodle of my head head head": a statement which is complemented with images of the boy apparently asleep in a bed equipped with springs under it, his bouncing off the bed, and, on the following blank pages, him somersaulting through space.

	Much as in My Bunny Lies over the Sea, where: 
		This cartoon begins as Bugs Bunny once again gets lost when he is tunneling to his vacation spot.
		He accidentally ends up in Scotland, instead of the La Brea Tar Pits, having once again not "made that left toin at Albahkoiky.
		" and mistakes a Scotsman named Angus MacRory dressed in traditional clothes and playing the bagpipes for a lady being attacked by a "horrible monster".
		Bugs Bunny jumps MacRory trying to rescue the "woman", and in the process he smashes his bagpipes to pieces.
		MacRory becomes enraged that his bagpipes have been absolutely ruined and threatens Bugs, who discovers that MacRory is actually a man, to which Bugs responds by pointing out that MacRory can't wear a kilt (mistaking it for a skirt) making it "indecent".
		MacRory is confused about the situation until Bugs comes back with a barrel and puts it on MacRory.
		Bugs then asks MacRory for the directions to the "La Brea Tar Pits in Los Ahn-galays", irritating MacRory even further until he runs and gets a blunderbuss, telling the rabbit that "there are no La Brea Tar Pits in Scotland.
		" When Bugs realizes the location he is in, he bids MacRory "Eh, what's up, MacDoc.
		" and runs for it just as MacRory shoots.
		MacRory chases after the bullet and picks it up ("It's been in the family for years"), puts the bullet back into his gun, and shoots at Bugs repeatedly, who dives back into his hole and comes back out moments later disguised as an elderly Scotsman accusing MacRory of "poaching on [his] property".
		MacRory doesn't believe him however and challenges him to a traditional Scottish duel a game.
		Bugs, upon hearing this, sets up a card game.
		MacRory corrects him, stating the challenge is a game of golf.
		Bugs then asks MacRory if he "ever gets tired of running those 18 bases".
		Of course, throughout the game Bugs manages to outsmart MacRory.
		On the first hole, Bugs, upon his first stroke missing the hole, digs another, bigger one to earn a hole in one.
		Bugs then nails MacRory's ball to the tee so it won't go anywhere, although MacRory still gets a hole in one anyway, to Bugs' protests.
		At hole 8, MacRory laughs at Bugs whose ball has fallen shorter of the hole than MacRory's.
		Bugs however turns his club into a pool cue and pots the ball into the hole, causing MacRory to break his club in half in anger.
		Later, after being seen hitting his ball out of a bunker multiple times to get his ball in hole 16, Bugs figures out (through imaginary sums in the air) how many hits it took.
		He says he got 2 strokes on the hole.
		MacRory, not believing Bugs at all, corrects him: "Two.
		FIFTY-FIVE.
		" An auction ensues until MacRory gives Bugs one point as his "final offer".
		At the last hole, MacRory gets a hole in one.
		Bugs however misses the hole altogether and quickly digs a channel with his club for the ball to roll through into the hole.
		When it's all said and done, Bugs declares himself the winner, much to the Scotsman's wrath, who accuses Bugs of cheating.
		However, MacRory accepts defeat after Bugs clears himself otherwise by mentioning about how the same situation occurred at other (fictional) golf tournaments ("the New Hebrides Open.
		Kaduffleblaze versus Fuddle in 19-aught-18.
		Fradis versus Ginfritter.
		Bizbo versus Stoigen in the Casablanca Amateur"), but still claims that he can't be beaten when it comes to playing bagpipes.
		After playing, he dares Bugs to try and top that which the rabbit does by literally dressing like a Scot and in the manner of a one-man band, manages to not only play the bagpipes, but also a trombone, saxophone, trumpet, two clarinets, cymbals on his feet, and a bass drum with his ears.
		Bugs takes one last glimpse at the audience before an iris-out.

		He chucks the man out almost totally naked, but two spheres suddenly fly by, and one sphere kills the man on the road while the other chases after Reggie.
		He manages to defeat them however, but then wakes up in a hospital sitting with Mike talking to him as he sits in a wheelchair, who apparently looks after him due to him having an early stage of dementia.
		He then tells Mike his story.
		In an apparent dream setting, Reggie meets a woman who mistakes him for a friend.
		Her car isn't working, so Reggie offers her a lift.
		They go to a cabin on a farm, and Reggie learns that a Bulgarian man named Demeter helps out.
		Reggie explains to her about his dealings with The Tall Man over the years, and she is amazed by his tale.
		He tries his usual lady wooing, but is turned down.
		As he plays a song, he cannot remember her name, and goes to sleep.
		Later, The Tall Man shows up with more of his deadly spheres.
		A flashback scene then shows Reggie in the hospital, but it is the hospital from the 1860s.
		The Tall Man (or his original identity, Jebediah) is lying in the bed next to him.
		They then talk.
		Jebediah explains he's nearly finished, and has lost many friends.
		He says they are both there basically to die.
		Reggie wakes up the next morning, remembering the lady's name is Dawn.
		He gets no answer when he asks her a question, and finds that she's been killed by spheres, that then give chase.
		Reggie equips himself with a shotgun.
		The spheres force him into a nearby barn.
		A man armed with an axe confronts him, and it's revealed he is Demeter.
		A sphere kills a horse.
		Another sphere then manages to get inside the barn, killing Demeter, before Reggie fights it off.
		Reggie speaks to Mike again in the hospital.
		Mike tells him about a new threat looming.
		Back in his dream, Reggie goes through the woods.
		Along a path, he encounters a gigantic sphere hovering in the sky, and Reggie is back at the hospital again.
		Reggie alternates between the other world in both his dream, and the present time.
		The Tall Man appears, and says their paths cross again.
		It's 1979; a younger self will attend a funeral in Morningside, and that all his efforts got him nowhere.
		The Tall Man proclaims he can resurrect Reggie's dead family in exchange for him ceasing his meddling.
		Reggie is next seen in a mortuary, contending with the dwarf "Lurker" followers of The Tall Man, and the Lady in Lavender appears.
		She is shot by Reggie and seemingly killed.
		Continuing on, Reggie goes into a large cave, shooting a dwarf and the place shakes.
		The Tall Man asks him if he's considered his offer, but when Reggie retaliates, The Tall Man again reminds him his chances are depleting.
		Reggie wants his friends Jodie and Mike back, but The Tall Man recognizes his "loyalty" for his friends as foolishness.
		In yet another dream sequence which he alternates with the nightmare world, Reggie is strapped to a gurney as armed masked people appear.
		One is called Chunk and the other is revealed to be the person Reggie knew as Dawn despite her death, but she says her name is actually Jane and she thinks Reggie is delusional.
		She radios in some people.
		Reggie fails to convince her they know each other, but she gets him medical attention instead.

	Much as in A Million Open Doors, where: 
		The story begins sometime in the 29th century on the planet Wilson (orbiting Arcturus) with a young man named Giraut and his romantic, swashbuckling friends, who are all members of the Nou Occitan culture and residents in the Quartier de Jovents, a sort of playground for teens and twenty-somethings who have not yet moved on to the more "grown-up" lifestyle of their parents.
		Technologically safeguarded, these young adults have swordfights in the streets with "neuroducer"  p es and frequent the taverns of the Quartier, living in an imaginative recreation of Occitan literature and the trobador tradition.
		However, Giraut is forced to grow up much more quickly than most of his friends, because one day his friend Aimeric, who was, before coming to Wilson and becoming a jovent, an economist in the Caledon culture of the nearest inhabited planet, Nansen (orbiting Mufrid), is called upon by the government to return to his home planet on a mission to regulate the effects of the springer on Caledonian economy.
		The springer is a method of instantaneous transportation which is quickly reuniting humanity across known space.
		Giraut decides to leave when he catches his girlfriend getting into the Interstellar "arts scene" (the art is called "sadoporn") which is an acting out against the exclusive values and code of honor valued by Giraut and his friends.
		Thus, Aimeric and Giraut advise the rational council of the Caledonians to adjust their economy to that of the rest of the universe so that the springer will have as few adverse effects as possible.
		When the Caledonians decide that Aimeric and Giraut, as well as the Interstellar government, are trying to usurp their power, they begin to try to seize back control of everything, and an urban conflict ensues.
		Giraut discovers among the strife who he really is and begins to see how fake his life back home was, and recognize faults in his home culture.
 travelling to Snow Hill, on which he meets Silence
	Much as in Moomin (1990 TV series), where: 
		The series begins with the arrive of spring in Moominvalley.
		Moomin, along with Little My, Moominpappa and Moominmamma wake up in Moominhouse, while Snufkin also comes back from his south travel on the first day of spring.
		The first eight episodes create coherent storyline that is based on the third novel, Finn Family Moomintroll.
		During the story, Moomin and his friends find out the magical silk hat, that turns out to belong to the Hobgoblin.
		He later gets his hat back from the Moomin family.
		The Moomins later find a wrecked boat, fix it and travel to a lonely island which is full of Hattifatteners.
		Next, two small creatures called Thingumy and Bob with a large suitcase arrive to the Moominhouse, and they are followed by the Groke.
		After the Moomins manage to evict the Groke from their way by giving her Moomin's seashell, it turns out that Thingumy and Bob are keeping the large "King's Ruby" in their suitcase.
		After Thingummy and Bob return Moominmamma's missing handbag, the Moomins celebrate the event with a large junket, where suddenly the Hobgoblin also arrives.
		Finally the problem of the King's Ruby's ownership is solved with the Hobgoblin's magic.
		Moomin takes place between a three-year period of time.
		Moomin and his family or friends manage to take part in two winter periods through the series, although the Moomins are normally supposed to fall into hibernation.
		Through the series, Snork, the Snork Maiden's inventor brother, designs and creates two flying ships of different type; the first is destroyed due sabotage and the second one gets finished at the end of the series.
		Before the second winter period, the Moomins and their friends also get to know Alicia and her grandmother, who is a witch.
		She teaches Alicia to become a real witch and has a negative opinion about the Moomins and their nice nature.
		As the series goes on, the witch however begins to appreciate them.
		At the end of the series, Snork decides to go on a journey with his finished flying ship while Alicia and her grandmother also leave the Moominvalley for the third winter period.
		The series concludes when the winter arrives, the Moomins fall into hibernation and Snufkin travels to the south once again.
, and later, Loco.
Upon arrival, Silence meets Pauline
	Much as in Witch Hunter Robin, where: 
		Robin Sena is a "craft user", born in Japan and raised by the Roman Catholic Church in Italy.
		She is trained to use her craft of fire to hunt down witches.
		Witchcraft is a genetic trait, dormant within a number of individuals within the human population.
		Powers can be "awakened" in these dormant human "seeds" at any time, which seems to also drive the awakened witch into various forms of homicidal madness or sociopathy.
		Trained hunters, craft-users or "seeds" themselves that have not become full witches, are needed to keep watch over "seeds" and hunt those whose abilities become active, serving in secret organizations, such as the parent branch "Solomon" and the "STN-J" branch in Japan, as self-appointed witch police to curtail the use of witchcraft in society, and to keep the witch kind a secret from the public.
		Even the police, who cooperate with STN-J in abnormal criminal cases, do not know what STN-J does.
		The series begins when Robin arrives in Japan to gain information for Solomon headquarters about a fabled item that holds the "secrets of the craft", while acting undercover as a new hunter to the STN-J in their efforts to capture witches.
		It is hinted that she subconsciously understands something of the STN-J's use of Orbo.
		Orbo is a green liquid that negates witch abilities.
		STN-J's hunters carry small vials of it on necklaces in the shape of a cross as a form of protection against their targets' craft.
		Hunters also carry air pistols which fire darts or pellets of Orbo that dampen witch powers when it enters the bloodstream of the target witch.
		Hunters who are craft-users or seeds can use Orbo with little ill effects, although their own powers are reportedly diminished while using it.
		Robin, a craft-user herself, says that she will not keep Orbo on her because she says it is "disgusting" ("     " or "bad feeling" in Japanese).
		As the series goes on, Robin grows increasingly uncomfortable with her role in hunting and capturing other witches.
		She begins to question the treatment they receive while incarcerated in the mysterious "Factory".
		After the discovery of "secrets of the craft," she is entrapped and attacked twice by "witch bullets".
		Subsequently, the STN-J is attacked, presumably for "secrets of the craft," although the Solomon attack was carried out to find what Zaizen, the director of the STN-J, was planning.
		Robin begins to worry that she will become a target and grows to suspect that her partner Amon will hunt her.
		Eventually, Robin does become a target of Solomon and labeled a witch, becoming "hunted".
		In the end, Robin finds out more about her craft and that of witches than she knew at the beginning.
		Initially, the series appears to take a "monster of the week" approach.
		About halfway through the 26-episode season, the characters and the relationships between them are established and the main plot gets underway.
, who promises to
	Much as in Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager), where: 
		Kes finds herself living short periods of time in reverse order.
		She first gains consciousness in sickbay as an elderly woman, surrounded by her Ocampa family born on Voyager.
		The Doctor is able to put her into a biotemporal chamber to try to extend Kes's normally short life-span.
		Her next period of consciousness occurs some days before, where the Doctor has affirmed that Kes is suffering from mental deterioration due to her old age and his plans to use the biotemporal chamber.
		Kes finds it difficult to be around the members of her family who she doesn't know.
		During these periods, she comes to learn that Voyager had suffered a "Year of Hell" some years before when facing a race called the Krenim that repeatedly assaulted the ship as it crossed their space, costing the lives of Captain Kathryn Janeway and B'Elanna Torres along with significant damage to the ship.
		As her periods of consciousness approach that point, she is able to work with the crew to postulate the nature of the Krenim temporal-based weapons and how to reverse the effects Kes is experiencing with a biotemporal chamber.
		The Doctor surmises that if Kes can obtain the temporal phase shift that affected her, he would be able to stop her backwards progression in time.
		Soon, Kes finds herself experiencing the period of the Year of Hell.
		The ship is significantly damaged, and an undetonated Krenim torpedo is lodged in the ship.
		Kes witnesses the deaths of Janeway and Torres, and convinces Chakotay to let her examine the dangerous weapon.
		She discovers the phase shift before passing out and coming to at an earlier period.
		Realizing she is getting near the time she first joined the Voyager crew, she is able to convince the Doctor of her symptoms and the means to stop it using the Kremin phase shift.
		However, even in the biotemporal chamber, she continues to flash back, soon finding herself back with the Ocampa and still growing younger.
		She regresses further to an infant, then to a fetus, before she suddenly starts moving forward in time.
		She eventually comes to in the present, two years since she joined Voyager and before the Year of Hell.
		The Doctor acknowledges the biotemporal chamber a success and Kes is cured.
		Despite a celebration in the holodeck for Kes's birthday, she wants to document her memories of the future, particularly the Year of Hell, to help Janeway and her crew, before she forgets them.
 raise his reward.
Pauline attempts to sell her house to Pollicut
	Much as in Timelike Infinity, where: 
		Set thousands of years in the future (AD 5407), the human race has been conquered by the Qax, a truly alien turbulent-liquid form of life, who now rule over the few star systems of human space   adopting processes from human history to effectively oppress the resentful race.
		Humans have encountered a few other races, including the astoundingly advanced Xeelee, and been conquered once before   by the Squeem   but successfully recovered.
		A human-built device, the Interface project, returns to the solar system after 1,500 years.
		The project, towed by the spaceship Cauchy, returns a wormhole gate, appearing to offer time travel due to the time 'difference' between the exits of the wormhole (relativistic time dilation), with one end having remained in the solar system and the other travelling at near lightspeed for a century.
		The Qax had destroyed the solar system gate, but a lashed-up human ship (a great chunk of soil including Stonehenge, crewed by a group called the Friends of Wigner) passes through the returning gate, travelling back to the unconquered humanity of 1,500 years ago.
		One of the crew of the Cauchy returns with the Friends, Miriam Berg.
		The Friends have a complex scheme, which does not include a simple military return-and-rescue   the 1,500-year technology gap makes this "risible".
		From the Wigner thought experiment they have postulated an unusual theory on the ultimate destiny of life in the universe.
		They believe that quantum wave-functions do not collapse like the Copenhagen interpretation holds, nor that each collapse actually buds off separate universes (like the quantum multiverse hypothesis holds) but rather that the universe is a participatory universe: the entire universe exists as a single massive quantum superposition, and that at the end of time (in the open universe of the Xeelee Sequence, time and space are unbounded, or more precisely, bounded only at the Cauchy boundaries of "Time-like infinity" and "Space-like infinity"), when intelligent life has collected all information (compare the Final anthropic principle and the Omega Point), and transformed into an "Ultimate Observer", who will make the "Final observation", the observation which collapses all the possible entangled wave-functions generated since the beginning of the universe.
		They believe further that the Ultimate Observer will not merely observe, but choose which world line will be the true world-line, and that it will choose the one in which humanity suffers no Squeem or Qax occupations.
		However, the Ultimate Observer cannot choose between worldlines if no information survives to its era to distinguish worldlines- if the UO never knows of humanity, it cannot choose a worldline favourable to it.
		In other words, some way is needed to securely send information forward in time.
		As a consequence of this necessity, they intend to turn Jupiter into a carefully formed singularity and use the precisely specified parameters as a method of encoding information.
		Miriam Berg is more concerned over the immediate fate of humanity, with the threat of the future Qax, and transmits a 'help' message to the gate designer Michael Poole.
		The Qax, naturally, panic a little at the escape to the past.
		A complex, unavoidably fragile species in their huge living Spline spacecraft, the few Qax present are somewhat at a loss.
		They decide to build their own Interface, with major human-collaborator assistance (headed by Ambassador Jasoft Parz), to create a link to their future to gain aid in resolving the problem   with more modern GUT-engine spacecraft they can make a 500-year link in just eighteen months.
		A startling high-technology future vessel (in truth, one of the legendary Xeelee nightfighters, an advanced and long-range fast scout ship), with a future Qax comes through the gate.
		Its first act is to execute the Qax Governor of Earth and gather up Parz, before passing through the original portal after the Friends and all humanity.
		The future Qax takes two Spline ships (presumably leaving behind the nightfighter; this might be the nightfighter that is discovered by the crew of The Great Northern millennia later in Ring) through the gate and on the journey reveals to Parz the reason behind its desire to completely destroy the human race.
		The future Qax tells Parz that over the centuries, the Qax had worn down humanity through constant oppression, and had eventually decided to completely eliminate its space-faring capabilities.
		But before they did, as economical traders, they wished to get as much value out of their human pilots as possible.
		So certain pilots were dispatched on a number of dangerous or quixotic missions.
		One such pilot was a man named Jim Bolder.
		The Qax had come into possession of a Xeelee nightfighter, and had modified it to support human control.
		Bolder's mission was simple: go to the Great Attractor, the cause of most galactic drift, and find out why and how it exists.
		Bolder travelled to the bottom of the gravitational well, and found the Ring.
		A torus a thousand light-years in diameter, constructed of an unknown substance, rotating at a large fraction of lightspeed.
		The Qax goes on to speculate that the torus created a Kerr metric, and that it allowed egress from the current universe, that it was in effect an escape route for the Xeelee.
		Before Parz, the Spline warship, and the Qax exit the wormhole, the Qax asks, "What do Xeelee fear, do you suppose.
		".
		Regardless, Bolder escaped the Great Attractor and returned to the Qax home system, where he was supposed to be taken into custody by dozens of Spline warships wielding gravity-wave based "starbreakers" and his priceless data on the god-like Xeelee's ultimate project secured.
		Bolder either did not, or somehow escaped; in the ensuing fight, the starbreakers were accidentally fired at the Qax system primary star, and true to their name, destabilised it, causing it to go nova.
		The Qax were forced to hurriedly evacuate.
		Many died, and the power of the Qax trading empire (and by extension, their Occupation of Earth) ended.
		In the past, Poole joins Berg on the Friend vessel shortly before the Qax emerges, having travelled aboard his ship, Hermit Crab, from the Oort Cloud.
		He is accompanied by a Virtual of his father, Harry.
		Together they elude the control of the Friends, whose project fails under the bombardment of the Spline's starbreaker beam.
		They commandeer the singularity cannon used to sculpt Jupiter, and fire some black holes into the Spline.
		Aided by Jasoft Parz's internal sabotage, Poole succeeds in ramming the Hermit Crab into the Spline, killing the sapience of the vessel.
		Harry takes over in lieu of the higher intelligence, and at the direction of Poole, steers it back into the wormhole: when inside, Poole intends to activate the hyperdrive, shattering the fragile dimensional warping of the wormhole, and of all wormholes connecting to it, thus saving humanity from further interference by the future.
		Poole's audacious plan succeeds, but with an unexpected side effect.
		As the hyperdrive activates, it somewhat shatters space-time, forming a long series of interconnected wormholes that hurl Poole 5 million years forward into the far future.
		Poole discovers a sad cosmos, in which the stars are guttering out; the Friends were wrong- intelligent life would not triumph and remake the cosmos, eventually leading to their Prime Observer.
		His ship shattered and broken, Poole begins dying, but at the last moment, an "anti-Xeelee" (whom it is implied is a being created by the Xeelee to be like them, except travelling like a tachyon backwards in time, the better to mould the Xeelee's early evolutionary history) takes a liking to Poole, and converts him into an intangible immortal being of "quantum functions".
		In this form, Poole travels the universe, but out of boredom, eventually begins to lapse into a quasi-coma- until an unexpected event occurs: a savage in a glass box, having travelled through a wormhole like Poole himself.
		"History resumed".
		(This final event is one of the early plot points of the Ring).

		Larry Chambers (Gregory Harrison) helped building the colony on Janus Five.
		He and fellow scientist Amanda Harper (Kim Huffman) run computer simulations that show the planet's star will flash over in a matter of days, emitting waves of deadly radiation, so dr Chambers urges evacuation.
		This is not a popular recommendation, especially among the colony's leaders who include council chairman Franklin Murdock (William Atherton), security head Montgomery Bennett (Alan Scarfe) and Amanda's father, Ian Harper (Ken Pogue).
		They point out that Chambers has been wrong before; the colony had to be moved at great cost after he warned of deadly volcanic activity that never occurred; and suggest that his judgment has been clouded by the death of his wife Elise.
		When that doesn't stop Chambers, Murdock and Bennett discredit him by falsely accusing him of being one of the aliens who originally inhabited the planet, suggesting that the evacuation plan is a plot to reclaim the planet for his people.
		Imprisoned and threatened with death, Chambers' only hope is that Amanda will uncover the truth in time to save him and the colony.

	Much as in The Six Million Dollar Mon, where: 
		Hermes starts performance reviews so that he may rid Planet Express of its worst employee, heavily implying that this will be Zoidberg.
		However upon completing the review, Hermes determines that he is the worst-performing employee, spending too much time on performance reviews.
		He fires himself and has the Central Bureaucracy replace him with a simple but efficient robot to handle the basic tasks of accounting for Planet Express.
		Hermes begins to feel useless as a human.
		This is compounded by the fact that he and his wife LaBarbara are attacked by the psychotic robot Roberto and eventually saved by the robot police officer URL.
		After Roberto is executed by electromagnetic chair, Hermes goes to a black market "upgrade" shop run by Yuri where he obtains a robotic upgrade from used robot parts.
		He finds the upgrade helps to improve his life, and starts returning to the shop frequently, upgrading his human body more and more despite promises to LaBarbara and his son Dwight that he would stop.
		Eventually, he has replaced all his human parts except his brain, and proves that he is more valuable than the simple robot that was put in his place.
		He is brought back aboard as part of the Planet Express crew.
		The crew later learns that Zoidberg had been getting Hermes' disused human parts and has stitched his body back up to use as a ventriloquist dummy called Little Hermes.
		Hermes feels that he needs to perform the last upgrade, by replacing his brain with a computer.
		When Yuri does not want to do the brain replacement, Hermes, Professor Farnsworth, and Bender head to the robot graveyard to exhume a robot body for a processor card.
		Unbeknownst to them, the processor card belonged to Roberto.
		In order for the procedure to work, Hermes locks LaBarbara, Dwight, and the Planet Express crew in the lab until Professor Farnsworth completes the transplant.
		LaBarbara and Hermes' friends convince Professor Farnsworth to stop this.
		Unfortunately Hermes still wants to continue with the implant.
		With the professor's refusal, Zoidberg agrees to complete the operation using Hermes' human body to help him.
		After the removal of the brain and placing it in Little Hermes, Hermes comes back to life in his original body and realizes that he has given up his humanity for the pointless pursuit of perfectionism.
		The crew later learns that after the transplant the processor card was that of Roberto (whose processor card was installed into the Hermes robot) as Roberto reshapes his head.
		Still wanting to eat Hermes' skin, Roberto used the new robot body to remove a piece of Hermes' skin off his forearm, but realizes too late he cannot eat it because of LaBarbara's curried goat she cooked over the many years.
		Roberto's new body then starts to melt quickly, thus saving the crew.

	Much as in SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, where: 
		The game revolves around the theme of robots invading Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob's hometown.
		Plankton, the evil genius owner of the Chum Bucket, has built a new machine called the Duplicatotron 3000 to produce an army of robots to use to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula.
		After creating them, he realizes that the switch on the Duplicatotron has accidentally been set to "Don't Obey" and the robots quickly kick him out of the Chum Bucket before taking it over and then wreaking havoc all over Bikini Bottom.
		Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with toy robots.
		SpongeBob is bored with the toys and wishes he could play with real robots.
		Patrick uses his "magic wishing shell", believing it will make their wish come true the following morning.
		SpongeBob wakes to find that his house has been trashed by real robots.
		He receives a fax from mr Krabs, stating that he would give SpongeBob a Golden Spatula for every certain amount of Shiny Objects he collects for him.
		Shiny Objects must be collected to open or activate various tolls throughout the game.
		Outside, SpongeBob finds a disappointed Plankton, who lies and claims that the robots appeared suddenly and kicked him out.
		Fooled by the diminutive villain, SpongeBob promises to help Plankton back into the Chum Bucket by embarking on a perilous quest to find golden spatulas and get rid of the robots.
		SpongeBob travels to Jellyfish Fields, where he finds that Squidward has been stung by jellyfish.
		SpongeBob defeats King Jellyfish in a battle and obtains some of his jelly for Squidward's stings.
		SpongeBob also helps mrs Puff by locating stolen steering wheels in Downtown Bikini Bottom, stolen paintings in Rock Bottom, and missing students/campers in the Kelp Forest.
		King Neptune calls SpongeBob and Patrick to the Poseidome to defeat Robot Sandy.
		He then goes to the Mermalair, where he fights Prawn, one of Mermaid Man's archenemies.
		He also helps Mermaidman and Barnacle Boy several other times throughout the game, as well as Larry the lobster, his pet snail Gary and the Flying Dutchman, in other areas like Goo Lagoon, Sand Mountain, and the Dutchman's Graveyard, where Sandy beats the Dutchman in a fight.
		Later, SpongeBob and Sandy save Squidward from Robot Patrick.
		SpongeBob then falls asleep, allowing him to enter his friends' dream worlds to search for more golden spatulas.
		After SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward gain access to the Chum Bucket, they discover Robot SpongeBob and Robot Plankton, and learn that Plankton was responsible for making the robots.
		Before the battle starts, Robot Plankton is frustrated because SpongeBob has interfered with his plans once again.
		SpongeBob must destroy all the green weak points to get in his brain to finish him off once and for all.
		After defeating the giant robots, SpongeBob hopes that Plankton learned his "lesson".
		The Duplicatotron produces several more Robot Planktons, which begin arguing among themselves.
		The game ends after SpongeBob says that their work is not done, as there are still many robots running amok in the city.
		The game then cuts to The Spongeball Arena, where the player rolls around in ball form in a large arena, while the credits roll on the screen.
		If the player collects all 100 golden spatulas, the game ends with a special surprise cutscene of all the game's characters singing the theme song.
		In the Game Boy Advance version, mr Krabs thinks the robot invasion is putting him out of business, so his assignment for SpongeBob is to fight the robots to get into the Chum Bucket to shut down Plankton's Duplicatron with the help of Mystery the Seahorse.
		At the end of the PC version, SpongeBob and Patrick discover that Plankton was the one behind the robot invasion.
		Plankton admits that it was his fault and that the robots are not listening to him and the only way to control the robots is to set the switch to "obey" mode.
		Instead, Patrick fools around with the machine, accidentally pulling its obey switch off, which turns off the machine and deprograms the robots.
		After SpongeBob and Patrick leave, Plankton tries to tell them that he will be back with another plan.

	Much as in Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood, where: 
		The Hundred Acre Wood was populated with characters fromA.
		Milne's Winnie the Pooh series of short stories.
		Each character had lost an item of value to them and wanted the item returned.
		The player moves through the Hundred Acre Wood and collects the missing items then returns them to their rightful owners.
		Only one item can be carried at a time, so picking up one item means leaving behind of whatever item is currently being carried.
		Some screens have interactive sub elements.
		For example: you could "climb" Pooh's tree and see the limb where he kept his honey pots safely out of the reach of flood waters (a reference to a scene in the Disney animated movie "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"and Chapter 9 ofA.
		Milne's book Winnie-the-Pooh).
		The game has no animation in the mode of a traditional Quest game such as King's Quest.
		Rather, the Hundred Acre Wood existed as a grid of connected static screens.
		Players move between the screen using the arrow keys and can only move North, South, East or West.
		The missing items are randomly assigned at the start of each new game to screens within this grid, although the various characters can always be found on the same screens.
		When an item is "dropped" on a screen in order to "pick up" another item, the dropped item stays on that screen until the user returns to retrieve it later, but not all items belong to anyone.
		Reuniting a character with their item results in a celebration screen.
		At random points the items can be lost if the player runs into Tigger (who bounces them), or when the wind starts again.

	Much as in Time Enough at Last, where: 
		Henpecked, far sighted bank teller and avid bookworm Henry Bemis (Meredith) works at his window in a bank, while reading David Copperfield, which causes him to shortchange an annoyed customer.
		Bemis's angry boss (Taylor), and later his nagging wife (deWit), both complain to him that he wastes far too much time reading "doggerel".
		As a cruel joke, his wife asks him to read poetry from one of his books to her; he eagerly obliges, only to find that she has inked over the text on every page, obscuring the words.
		Seconds later, she destroys the book by ripping the pages from it much to Henry's dismay.
		The next day, as usual, Henry takes his lunch break in the bank's vault, where his reading will not be disturbed.
		Moments after he sees a newspaper headline, which reads "H-Bomb Capable of Total Destruction", an enormous explosion outside the bank violently shakes the vault, knocking Bemis unconscious.
		After regaining consciousness and recovering the thick glasses required for him to see, Bemis emerges from the vault to find the bank demolished and everyone in it dead.
		Leaving the bank, he sees that the entire city has been destroyed, and realizes that a nuclear war has devastated the Earth, but that his being in the vault has saved him.
		Finding himself totally alone in a shattered world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to share it with, Bemis succumbs to despair.
		As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees the ruins of the public library in the distance.
		Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that he has all the time in the world to read them without interruption.
		His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts the books he looks forward to reading for years to come.
		Just as he bends down to pick up the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter.
		In shock, he picks up the broken remains of the glasses he is virtually blind without, and says, "That's not fair.

	Much as in Timeline (novel), where: 
		In the New Mexico desert, a vacationing couple finds a wandering ill man and brings him to a hospital.
		Doctors discover he has bizarre deformities in his blood vessels and is an employee of the company ITC.
		In the Dordogne region of France, Professor Edward Johnston heads a team of historians and archaeologists studying the medieval towns of Castelgard and La Roque.
		Suspicious of the knowledge of the site shown by their financier ITC, Johnston flies to ITC's headquarters in New Mexico to investigate.
		While he is gone, the students make disturbing discoveries in the ruins, among them the lens of Johnston's eyeglasses and a message in contemporary English.
		Graduate researchers Chris Hughes, Kate Erickson, Andr  Marek, and David Stern follow him to ITC and meet its founder Robert Doniger, who tells them Johnston has used their quantum technology to travel to the year 1357.
		Chris, Kate, and Marek agree to travel back themselves to recover him.
		When they arrive, though, they are immediately attacked by horsemen who kill the ITC military escorts.
		A grenade returns through the machine and explodes, damaging the present-day transit pad.
		Unable to return, Kate and Marek see Johnston held by the men of Lord Oliver of Castelgard.
		Separated from the others, Chris accidentally declares himself as nobility to a boy who leads him to Castelgard.
		The boy is revealed to be the disguised Lady Claire, trying to escape from the leader of the horsemen, Sir Guy de Malegant.
		In the castle, Chris and Andr  are challenged to a joust by Guy, which Chris survives only thanks to Marek's knowledge of the era.
		Oliver orders their deaths, but Kate helps them escape Castelgard, and they are pursued by Guy and his knight Robert de Kere.
		Oliver believes that Johnston knows a secret passageway into the otherwise impenetrable castle of La Roque; Oliver's enemy Arnaut de Cervole is approaching the Dordogne to lay siege and Oliver wants the secret to defend it.
		After Lady Claire helps them elude Arnaut, Chris and Kate search for the passage while Andr  enters La Roque as Johnston's assistant.
		Johnston helps Oliver develop a weapon, knowing that historically Oliver loses the siege.
		Chris deduces that someone else from the future is in the past with them, and Robert de Kere reveals that he is Rob Deckard, an ITC employee and former marine driven insane from the accumulation of "transcription errors," deformities that build up over multiple quantum trips.
		De Kere intends to take their trip home for himself.
		As Arnaut's siege begins, Kate fights and kills Guy in a chase on the rafters of La Roque, while Andr  and Chris are able to rescue Johnston from the dungeon when Arnaut himself appears and defeats Oliver in a duel.
		As the battle rages, de Kere attacks Chris to get his machine marker, but Chris manages to set him on fire with Johnston's gunpowder.
		ITC and Stern repair the transit pad just in time for the travelers' return.
		Andr  who realizes he has longed for this life decides to remain in the past while Chris, Kate, and Johnston return to 1999.
		When it becomes clear that Doniger had little regard for the lives of the travelers, the researchers and engineers send him to 1348 the outbreak of the Black Death.
		In the epilogue, Chris and Kate are expecting a child together.
		The researchers find Andr  and Lady Claire's graves and discover that Andr  lived out a happy and satisfying life.

	Much as in Confessor (novel), where: 
		A short plot description of the book was released on the author's official website, which read: Richard Rahl, leader of the D'Haran Empire, has been captured by an Imperial Order commander, who spared his life (under the guise of Ruben Rybnik) to be the point man for the commander's Ja'La dh Jin team.
		Kahlan is also Jagang's prisoner, surrounded by special guards who can see her.
		During Richard's imprisonment, he is warned by a cloaked specter that he is now a player of the Boxes of Orden.
		Sister Ulicia is also visited by this figure, and is told that the time to open the Boxes has been reset to one year from the first day of winter-the day that Nicci set the Boxes into motion under Richard's name.
		Rachel is discovered missing from the Keep.
		That night, the witch woman Six enters the Keep and steals the third box of Orden from Nicci and Zedd.
		Zedd discovers the Keep's warning that the Wizard's Keep is dying due to the contamination of the chimes, and places a spell to protect it from future damage.
		Zedd, Rikka, and Tom then head to Tamarang to remove the spell blocking Richard's gift.
		In an attempt to breach the People's Palace, Jagang orders a massive ramp built to reach the plateau, bypassing the natural defenses of the Palace.
		While excavating dirt for the ramp in the Azrith Plains, Jagang's diggers stumbled upon the catacombs under the People's Palace, which provide a secret entryway.
		Three Sisters of the Dark enter, killing Ann and capturing Nicci, while soldiers are sent into the catacombs to prepare an attack.
		The Sisters of the Dark discover what they believe to be the original Book of Counted Shadows in Bandakar.
		Richard, after realizing that Jagang and the Sisters with him would recognize him during team inspections and throughout the tournament, disguises himself by covering the faces and bodies of his teammates and himself with intimidating symbols and parts of spell-forms.
		His team defeats Jagang's team in the tournament final, but Jagang refuses to accept his team's loss and invalidates the win twice, leading to a riot in the camp, during which Richard and Nicci escape, while Kahlan is 'rescued' by Samuel.
		Richard and Nicci, with Adie's help, enters the Palace through the catacombs, where Cara and Nathan help them wipe out the Order forces hiding there.
		Rachel is lured to Tamarang by Violet, who has drawn a spell around her that sets 'ghostie gobblies' to destroy her.
		Along the way, she is given a piece of chalk by Shota, disguised as Rachel's mother, and uses this to transfer the spell to Violet.
		Rachel then restores Richard's gift.
		Shota reappear as Rachel's mother and sends her to deliver a message with Gratis to the Mud People.
		On the way to Tamarang, Zedd, Rikka, and Tom are captured by Six, who is in league with Jagang and has helped attack D'Haran forces in the Old World.
		Richard is warned by Nicci that he must not reveal his love for Kahlan to her, lest Kahlan's lost memories alone fail to be restored, much like Richard, in the first book of the series, could not be told before finding the way to intimately love a Confessor while being untouched by her power.
		Richard is taught many spells and spell-forms by Nicki regarding the Boxes of Orden.
		He tests his knowledge by helping priestess Jillian, who was brought to the Azrith Plains after Jagang's men hunted her down in Caska, give the Order's army terrible nightmares.
		Jagang is given particularly nasty dreams, mostly involving Nicci.
		After a demand for surrender by Jagang, Richard then sends himself to the Underworld, using Denna as a spirit guide, and retrieves everyone's memories of Kahl an.
		Unfortunately, he is attacked by the pursuing beast earlier sent against him.
		He destroys the beast and escapes by releasing Additive Magic into the Underworld, whence he is physically projected into a gathering of the Mud People.
		He is greeted by Chase and Rachel, who, with Gratch's help, had told the Mud People to hold a gathering to await him.
		At the Palace, Nathan assumes Richard is dead and, acting on Richard's instructions, accepts Jagang's terms of surrender, which include surrendering Nicci to Jagang and giving the Order's Sisters access to the Garden of Life in order to open the boxes.
		Samuel attempts to rape Kahlan; during the struggle, she touches the Sword of Truth, which restores her knowledge, but not her memories, of being a Confessor and releases her power to take control of him.
		Samuel reveals he is an agent for Six, and that Richard and Kahlan were once married.
		He then dies when she refuses to forgive his attempt against her.
		Richard meets Kahlan on the way to Tamarang, but refuses to answer her questions about their marriage, for fear of contaminating the spell upon her.
		He gives her Spirit in compensation.
		Six has imprisoned Zedd, Tom, and Rikka, and appears as Richard and Kahlan arrive in Tamarang.
		As Six is about to recapture them, Shota appears as Six's mother.
		She kills Six and then Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd fly back to the People's Palace on the red dragon Six had enslaved; now revealed to be Scarlet's son Gregory, whom Richard saved as an egg.
		At the Palace, Richard allows Jagang and his Sisters of the Dark to open the boxes of Orden.
		During the ritual, Jagang goes to retrieve Nicci from the dungeon.
		However, Nicci locks a Rada'Han around Jagang's neck, rendering him powerless.
		After taking him back to the Garden of Life, she eventually kills him unceremoniously to prevent his martyrdom.
		In the Garden of Life, the Sisters of the Dark discover the correct box and open it; however, they find a flaw in their success.
		Richard explains that all of the Books of Counted Shadows were false keys to the boxes; whereas if they had the true key, they would still fail by reason of malicious intent.
		Immediately, the Sisters are drawn into the Underworld.
		Richard explains that the true key to the Magic of Orden is the Sword of Truth.
		Kahlan tells Richard she loves him, revealing that her emotions have contaminated her chances of regaining memory.
		Richard uses the Sword to reveal the correct box and then to capture its magic.
		Now in command of life and death, he uses the magic to send the followers of the Order to a new world, devoid of magic; his half-sister Jennsen, her compatriots the Bandakar, and her suitor Tom decides to relocate to the new world.
		He also uses Orden to repair the damage caused by the chimes, and to send Chainfire to the new world he has created, ensuring the complete removal of magic from that world, and removing all its inhabitants' memories of their previous world.
		As Richard goes to close the opening between worlds, he fears Kahlan is lost to him; she, however, replies that she was protected from this loss because she had fallen in love with him on her own, much as he had with her from the beginning.
		An epilogue shows Tom and Jennsen expecting a child, who will carry the Rahl name, and shows the emigrants gradually forgetting Richard and everything from their previous world.
		The book ends with the marriage of Cara and General Meiffert.
		It is revealed that the Sisters of the Light have moved into the Wizard's Keep, where along with Zedd, they can continue to teach young wizards.
		Chase (now a Warden of the Keep) and his family have also moved into the Keep, as have Adie and Friedrich, who are now a mated pair.
		Under Zedd's questions, Richard admits taking Panis Rahl's spell from red fruit, so that it is no longer poison, and to bringing back the Temple of the Winds to the world of the living.
		After Cara and Benjamin's wedding, the devotion bells begin to ring.
		Richard prevents the people from kneeling, proclaiming that they are no longer his subjects.

Despite Pauline's pleas
	Much as in Lord of the Flies, where: 
		In the midst of a war-time evacuation, a British aeroplane crashes on or near an isolated island in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean.
		The only survivors are boys in their middle childhood or preadolescence.
		Two boys the fair-haired Ralph and an overweight, bespectacled boy nicknamed "Piggy" find a conch, which Ralph uses as a horn to congregate all the survivors to one area.
		Due largely to the fact that Ralph appears responsible for bringing all the survivors together, he immediately commands some authority over the other boys and is quickly elected their "chief", but he does not receive the votes of the members of a boys' choir, led by the red-headed Jack Merridew.
		Ralph establishes three primary policies: to have fun, survive, and to constantly maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships to their presence on the island and thus rescue them.
		The boys create a form of democracy by declaring that whoever holds the conch shall also be able to speak at their formal gatherings and receive the attentive silence of the larger group.
		Jack organises his choir into a hunting party responsible for discovering a food source.
		Ralph, Jack, and a quiet, dreamy boy named Simon soon form a loose triumvirate of leaders with Ralph as the ultimate authority.
		Though he is Ralph's only real confidant, Piggy is quickly made into an outcast by his fellow "biguns" (older boys) and becomes an unwilling source of laughs for the other children while being hated by Jack.
		Simon, in addition to supervising the project of constructing shelters, feels an instinctive need to protect the "littluns" (younger boys).
		The semblance of order quickly deteriorates as the majority of the boys turn idle; they give little aid in building shelters, spend their time having fun and begin to develop paranoias about the island.
		The central paranoia refers to a supposed monster they call the "beast", which they all slowly begin to believe exists on the island.
		Ralph insists that no such beast exists, but Jack, who has started a power struggle with Ralph, gains a level of control over the group by boldly promising to kill the creature.
		At one point, Jack summons all of his hunters to hunt down a wild pig, drawing away those assigned to maintain the signal fire.
		A ship travels by the island, but without the boys' smoke signal to alert the ship's crew, the vessel continues without stopping.
		Ralph angrily confronts Jack about his failure to maintain the signal; in frustration Jack assaults Piggy, breaking his glasses.
		The boys subsequently enjoy their first feast.
		Angered by the failure of the boys to attract potential rescuers, Ralph considers relinquishing his position as leader, but is convinced not to do so by Piggy, who both understands Ralph's importance, and deeply fears what will become of him should Jack take total control.
		One night, an aerial battle occurs near the island while the boys sleep, during which a fighter pilot ejects from his plane and dies during the descent.
		His body drifts down to the island in his parachute; both get tangled in a tree near the top of the mountain.
		Later on, while Jack continues to scheme against Ralph, twins Sam and Eric, now assigned to the maintenance of the signal fire, see the corpse of the fighter pilot and his parachute in the dark.
		Mistaking the corpse for the beast, they run to the cluster of shelters that Ralph and Simon have erected to warn the others.
		This unexpected meeting again raises tensions between Jack and Ralph.
		Shortly thereafter, Jack decides to lead a party to the other side of the island, where a mountain of stones, later called Castle Rock, forms a place where he claims the beast resides.
		Only Ralph and a quiet suspicious boy, Jack's closest supporter Roger, agree to go; Ralph turns back shortly before the other two boys but eventually all three see the parachutist whose head rises via the wind; they then flee, now believing the beast is truly real.
		When they arrive at the shelters, Jack calls an assembly and tries to turn the others against Ralph, asking for them to remove him from his position.
		Receiving no support, Jack storms off alone to form his own tribe.
		Roger immediately sneaks off to join Jack, and slowly an increasing amount of older boys abandon Ralph to join Jack's tribe.
		Jack's tribe continues to lure recruits in from the main group by promising feasts of cooked pig.
		The members begin to paint their faces and enact bizarre rites, including sacrifices to the beast.
		Simon, who faints frequently and is likely an epileptic, has a secret hide-away where he goes to be alone.
		One day while he is there, Jack and his followers erect a faux sacrifice to the beast near-by: a pig's head, mounted on a sharpened stick, and soon swarming with scavenging flies.
		Simon conducts an imaginary dialogue with the head, which he dubs the "Lord of the Flies".
		The head mocks Simon's notion that the beast is a real entity, "something you could hunt and kill", and reveals the truth: they, the boys, are the beast; it is inside them all.
		The Lord of the Flies also warns Simon that he is in danger, because he represents the soul of man, and predicts that the others will kill him.
		Simon climbs the mountain alone and discovers that the beast is only a dead parachutist trapped by rocks being moved by the wind.
		Rushing down to tell the others, Simon is seen by the boys who are engaged in a ritual dance.
		The frenzied boys mistake Simon for the beast, attack him, and beat him to death.
		Jack and his rebel band decide that the real symbol of power on the island is not the conch, but Piggy's glasses the only means the boys have of starting a fire.
		They raid Ralph's camp, confiscate the glasses, and return to their abode on Castle Rock.
		Ralph, now deserted by most of his supporters, journeys to Castle Rock to confront Jack and secure the glasses.
		Taking the conch and accompanied only by Piggy, Sam, and Eric, Ralph finds the tribe and demands that they return the valuable object.
		Confirming their total rejection of Ralph's authority, the tribe captures and binds the twins under Jack's command.
		Ralph and Jack engage in a fight which neither wins before Piggy tries once more to address the tribe.
		Any sense of order or safety is permanently eroded when Roger, now sadistic, deliberately drops a boulder from his vantage point above, brutally killing Piggy and shattering the conch.
		Ralph manages to escape, but Sam and Eric are tortured by Roger until they agree to join Jack's tribe.
		Ralph secretly confronts Sam and Eric who warn him that Jack and Roger hate him and that Roger has sharpened a stick at both ends, implying the tribe intends to hunt him like a pig and behead him.
		The following morning, Jack orders his tribe to begin a hunt for Ralph.
		Jack's savages set fire to the forest while Ralph desperately weighs his options for survival.
		Following a long chase, most of the island is consumed in flames.
		With the hunters closely behind him, Ralph trips and falls.
		He looks up at a uniformed adult   a naval officer whose party has landed from a passing war-ship to investigate the fire.
		Ralph bursts into tears over the death of Piggy and the "end of innocence".
		Jack and the other children, filthy and unkempt, also revert to their true ages and erupt into sobs.
		The officer expresses his disappointment at seeing British boys exhibiting such feral, warlike behaviour before turning to stare awkwardly at his own war-ship.

	Much as in Revenge of the Nerds, where: 
		Best friends and nerds Lewis Skolnick and Gilbert Lowe enroll in Adams College to study computer science.
		They are kicked out of the freshmen dorms by the Alpha Betas, a fraternity composed primarily of football team members, after the Alphas carelessly burn down their own frat house.
		Dean Ulich sets up the freshmen in temporary quarters in the school's gymnasium, but allows them to rush the fraternities to alleviate their housing situation.
		Lewis, Gilbert, and other nerds fail to gain fraternity membership, but are able to rent and completely renovate a rundown two-story campus house.
		Their success irks Stan Gable, the lead Alpha Beta and Adams' star quarterback; he sets his fellow fraternity members against the nerds, pulling several pranks.
		The nerds approach the campus police for help, but are bound by the fraternities' Greek Council that adjudicates all such pranks; the only way to appeal the Greek Council's inaction is to join a national fraternity.
		The nerds attempt to gain national membership, eventually selecting the black fraternity Lambda Lambda Lambda (Tri-Lambs).
		The head of the Tri-Lambs, Jefferson, is not thrilled by the notion of granting a charter to a primarily nerd chapter, but the fraternity's bylaws obligate them to give any chapter applicant a 60-day probationary membership.
		The nerds invite Jefferson to a Lambda party with the Omega Mu sorority, which contain similar nerdy women including Gilbert's girlfriend Judy; their party is livened up when Booger supplies joints with high quality marijuana.
		The Alpha Betas, along with the Pi Delta Pis, to which Stan's head cheerleader girlfriend Betty Childs belongs, let a herd of pigs into the party, disrupting it, allowing Jefferson to see the discrimination the nerds face.
		The nerds later take their revenge on both groups by staging a panty raid on the Pi Delta Pis and pouring liquid heat into the Alpha Betas' jock straps.
		Jefferson is impressed by the nerds' willingness to stand up for themselves, and he officially names them a Tri-Lamb chapter.
		Despite their fraternity membership, Lewis and Gilbert find their prank charges stonewalled by Stan, who is also president of the Greek Council.
		The nerds realize they can only stop Stan by the Tri-Lambs winning the upcoming Greek Games during homecoming, becoming the heads of the Greek Council.
		Using their high intelligence, the nerds, working with the Omega Mus, doggedly stay in second place behind the Alpha Betas and Pi Delta Pis throughout the sporting events.
		During the costume/charity sale events, the nerds use nude photos of Betty (taken during their earlier revenge pranks) to outsell the Alpha Betas.

		Just then, Hinkle's rabbit, Hocus Pocus, hops outside with Hinkle's hat over him.
		The wind then blows the hat onto Frosty's head, bringing him to life.
		However, Hinkle takes the hat back after finding out that it's magic.
		When the children refuse him to take the hat back, Hinkle refuses, saying that when they grow up, they'll learn that snowmen can't come to life and leaves.
		However, Hocus escapes with the hat and returns it to the children who bring Frosty back to life.
		However, the temperature starts to rise and Frosty worries he will melt.
		So the children decide to take him to the North Pole.
		After realizing they have no money to buy train tickets, Frosty and Karen hitch a ride on a train headed north in a refrigerator car.
		However, Hinkle sneaks aboard, still vowing to get his hat back.
		Noticing that Karen is freezing in the boxcar, Frosty vows to warm her up.
		Frosty suggests Hocus to tell the forest animals to build a fire for her and find Santa Claus to come bring her home and him to the North Pole.
		But Hinkle soon shows up and puts out the fire.
		Frosty and Karen escape Hinkle, and see a greenhouse used to grow Christmas poinsettias.
		The exhausted Hinkle closes the door behind them.
		Meanwhile, Santa arrives and Hocus leads him to the greenhouse, only to find Karen crying over a melted Frosty.
		But Santa explains that Frosty is made of Christmas snow and will come back every winter.
		He then opens the greenhouse door, reviving Frosty.
		But just as they're about to put his hat on to bring him back to life, Hinkle still demands that he wants the hat back.
		But Santa warns him that if he takes it, he'll never get another Christmas present for the rest of his life until Santa suggests that if he writes his apologies, he'll get a new hat in his stocking on Christmas morning.
		After Hinkle runs home to write his apologies, Santa puts Frosty's hat on him, bringing him back to life, takes Karen home, and brings Frosty back to the North Pole, promising that he'll return next year.
		As the end credits roll, Frosty and the children parade through town, including a reformed Professor Hinkle wearing his new hat.
		At the end of the parade, Frosty boards Santa's sleigh and they leave for the North Pole with Frosty altering the song's last lyric, saying, "I'll be back on Christmas Day.

		Unemployed and branded a trouble-maker, Jaikishan lives a poor lifestyle in a slum-area called Asha Colony, very near Andher's Lokhandwala Complex along with his sister, Seema; mom and dad.
		He comes to the rescue of a homeless orphan, Mili, who suffers from a deep inferiority complex, and permits her to live with his family.
		Brutally outspoken, he believes that India should be awarded unlimited gold medals for corruption at all levels, fully aware that these beliefs portray him as a 'revolutionary', and prevent him from securing any gainful employment.

	Much as in Slaughter (1972 film), where: 
		After the father of Vietnam veteran and ex-Green Beret captain Slaughter (Jim Brown) is killed by a car bomb, he becomes obsessed with avenging the murder.
		He learns it was arranged by a Cleveland organized-crime gang and tracks down the mobster personally responsible, killing a Mafia member in the process.
		The murderer, however, manages to escape.
		Slaughter gets arrested and charged with first-degree murder, but Treasury Department official Price (Cameron Mitchell) offers to drop all charges if he agrees to go to an unnamed South American country to capture the escaped mobster, who apparently has a super-computer that helps him run his crime empire.
		Upon arriving, Slaughter meets up with two fellow agents, Harry (Don Gordon) and Kim (Marlene Clark), having previously known Kim.
		The mobster responsible for the murder of Slaughter's father is Dominic Hoffo (Rip Torn), right-hand man of kingpin Felice (Norman Alfe).
		Hoffo, a blatant racist and sociopath, instantly hates Slaughter, especially when his comare Ann (Stella Stevens), a professional working for the organization, makes it clear she's delighted to have been ordered by Felice to present herself to Slaughter as a peace offering.
		Slaughter, having no intention of backing down from his vendetta, accepts Ann's offer with pleasure, and her loyalties quickly transfer to him.
		Numerous fights and gun battles ensue, with the hot-headed Hoffo eventually killing the more reasonable Felice and assuming command, beating Ann viciously for her disloyalty.
		After a climactic shootout and lengthy car chase, Slaughter succeeds in killing Hoffo by incinerating him in a crashed vehicle.

	Much as in What! No Beer?, where: 
		Elmer Butts, taxidermist, goes to a dry rally, where he follows the beautiful Hortense and her gangster boyfriend Butch Laredo into the meeting hall.
		He sits by Hortense, only to be thrown out after the speaker asks if they want liquor back in this country, and he calls out  Yes.
		  The next day, Jimmy Potts, driving a car covered in pro-booze stickers, brings a fish to Elmer s shop for stuffing.
		It's Election Day, and there's a referendum on Prohibition on the ballot.
		Jimmy convinces Elmer to vote wet, and they go to the polls only to cause confusion and collapse the booths.
		Later, at Jimmy s barbershop, the radio reports that the country has voted to repeal Prohibition.
		At a hotel, a group of Spike Moran s gangsters realize that their bootlegging operation is washed up.
		They wonder what Butch will do.
		At Butch s place, Hortense asks if this means that she can t have her Rolls Royce town car.
		Butch tells her she ll be lucky to have a wheelbarrow, and he shoots the radio.
		Back at the barbershop, Jimmy breaks off of the celebratory conga line to tell Elmer his million dollar idea: buying a brewery.
		Elmer wants to be rich, too, so he can marry   and he has $10,000 hidden in his stuffed animals.
		They collect the money and take it to the president of the bank that foreclosed on the local brewery.
		Jimmy s offer of $10,000 cash plus $5,00 a month is quickly accepted.
		Elmer and Jimmy arrive at the brewery, toting bags of supplies.
		They find three unemployed homeless men there, and they hire them.
		After dousing themselves with an unpredictable water hose, they assemble the ingredients for a five gallon batch of beer in the huge tank.
		It only makes a small puddle at the bottom of the tank.
		They realize that they need 500 gallons, so after donning raincoats, they start work.
		Later, they open the vat.
		Suds bubble up over the top.
		They bottle as much as the can, having several mishaps with exploding bottles and foam piling up over their heads.
		They put up a sign:  Real beer   5 cents  and wait for customers.
		Instead the cops come in and raid them.
		The vote didn t repeal Prohibition, it was only advisory.
		In court, the judge reads the charges and Jimmy protests that it s persecution, but the chemist reports that it wasn t beer, it was only brown dishwater.
		On the stoop outside the brewery, Jimmy consoles Elmer on the loss of his nest egg.
		Jimmy goes in and talks to the workers, and one, Schultz, reveals that he s a master brewer.
		To make back Elmer s money, Jimmy decides to make real beer and tell Elmer that it's near beer.
		Weeks later, Spike and Butch meet to discuss who's cut in on their racket.
		Butch vows to kill him.
		Spike and an associate interrupt Elmer, who s reading a book: Modern Salesmanship and Big Business.
		Spike offers to buy 1,000 barrels a day, and gives Elmer $10,000 down payment.
		Full of the advice from the book, Elmer agrees.
		Spike says that his partners stay partners as long as they live, and he leaves.
		Elmer tells the three workers that they need to increase production, then goes to the State Employment Bureau for 50 more men.
		After they start work, Jimmy comes in and learns about the contract; he has a meltdown.
		He puts the $10,000 in his overcoat pocket, which he hangs on the office coat rack, and leaves.
		Hortense drives up and pretends to twist her ankle, so Elmer must rescue her and carry her to the office.
		After she fakes a faint, he douses her with water, so she takes off her dress and puts on Jimmy's overcoat.
		She vamps Elmer until he mentions that Spike is their partner.
		Having learned what she came for, she leaves.
		Jimmy comes in, looking for his overcoat.
		Elmer tells him that Hortense has it.
		When Jimmy tells him about the money, Elmer doesn't mind: she s the girl for whom he wants to make a million.
		Hortense tells Butch that Spike is working with the brewers.
		When the $10,000 falls out of the coat, Butch calls her a tramp and hits her.
		She calls Elmer and he asks about the money.
		She denies seeing it, but he tells her to keep it and buy herself a Rolls.
		He asks her out on a walk in the park the next day.
		She's appalled.
		At Spike s office, two men say that Butch threatened to kill them if they picked up the beer.
		Elmer volunteered to deliver it.
		At the brewery, Elmer drives the truck away and down the street.
		Butch s men decide to kill him at the top of a hill, but the trucks  tire blows out halfway up, and the barrels fall off of the back and chase the gangsters away.
		Jimmy arrives, and Elmer mourns the loss of the near beer.
		Jimmy explains that it was real beer, and they re involved with gangsters.
		Elmer won't leave town, because he s got a date at the park.

		At the brewery, Jimmy learns that Butch killed Spike.
		Butch arrives and announces that now he s their partner.
		Elmer comes in and tells them that Hortense loves him, but Butch asks  does she.
		  Meanwhile, the cops are planning to raid the brewery.
		Back at the brewery office, Hortense intercepts a man who s going to tell Butch about the raid.
		On the brewery floor, Butch orders that no one may come in or out, and he posts guards on all of the doors.
		While giving Elmer the brush-off, Hortense slips him a note about the raid.
		Elmer escapes in a barrel, grabs a blackboard, and drives away.
		He shows what he's written on the board to everyone on the street: Free Beer at the Brewery.
		The factory is mobbed, and by the time the police arrive, there s no beer left.
		Later, a Senator speaks to Congress, telling the story of a town in his state where the gangsters were put out of business when the people stormed the brewery.
		He calls for an end to Prohibition.
		After the headline  Beer Legalized , crowds cheer, grain gets harvested, and beer gets made and delivered.
		At Butt's Beer Garden, Elmer and Jimmy arrive in an open car.
		Jimmy offers free beer, and the two get mobbed for autographs.
		The crowd steals their clothes, too.
		Hortense joins and asks if Elmer is hurt   he isn't.
		Jimmy, holding a frosty brew aloft, addresses the camera:  It's your turn next folks.
		It won't be long now.
		  He blows off the head and chugs some down.
