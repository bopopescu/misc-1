<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2010/12/skepticism-and-sincere-anomalist.html">Skepticism and the Sincere Anomalist</a></h2>
<p><span>The typical group &lsquo;investigating&rsquo; a claim of the paranormal (or anything that could be considered 'high strangeness&rsquo;) is well-known to everyone: half the group is the Mulder camp, and half is the Scully camp. In real life, these two types don&rsquo;t get along as well as they do on television, but they exhibit the same characteristics: the Mulder group insists, regardless of evidence to the contrary, that the phenomenon in question is something strange (if not completely supernatural), while the Scully group insists, regardless of evidence to the contrary, that there is a 'rational&rsquo; explanation (where 'rational&rsquo; here goes by some definition known only to pseudoskeptics and kept far away from any apparent consistency). But, again unlike television, these two types (both together and on their own) are almost completely incapable of understanding anything legitimately outside of their existing scope of knowledge: they are both varieties of true believers.</span><br/><br/><span>In the fortean community, the Scully type is typically called the 'pseudoskeptic&rsquo;. This is a reactionary type, living to 'debunk&rsquo; anything that runs counter to his or her existing model of reality. The 'debunking&rsquo;, upon close inspection, loses its thin pretense of rationality and is exposed as a simple mammalian response to threat. In the case of the pseudoskeptic, the threat is typically conflict with whatever they learned in high school science class, and it highly resembles the response of a religious fanatic when dogma is directly conflicted.</span><br/><br/><span>In the skeptic community, the Mulder type is typically called a 'woo&rsquo;. This type is also a reactionary type, living to 'prove&rsquo; the existence of something that runs counter to the consensus model of reality. This 'proof&rsquo;, upon close inspection, loses its thin pretense of truth-seeking and is exposed as an application of wishful thinking on a large scale: the 'woo&rsquo; wants to believe, and will ignore any evidence to the contrary.</span></p>
<p>These two types are actually not terribly dissimilar. They are both true believers, living to validate their own personal views of the universe. The main difference is that the pseudoskeptic has a model of the universe very close to that of the consensus, while the woo has a model of the universe that is very different. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not the models are correct or have predictive value; truth ceases to matter once belief takes the stage. Despite the cries of the pseudoskeptic, neither of these types are skeptical, either. The skeptic actively questions both assumptions and claims, while the pseudoskeptic merely 'debunks&rsquo; them.<br/><br/>Fortean anomalism is on the fringe of known science, and can be expected to stay there indefinitely; anomalists seek the fringe of the known, and inhabit the borderland between the mundane and the batshit darkness just beyond it. This doesn&rsquo;t make skepticism less important: it makes skepticism more important, and makes belief even more dangerous. There is a tendency for the mind to see what it expects; the mental model affects perception as much as perception affects the mental model. Since the anomalist deals with the unknown, the tendency to see the expected (be it a weather balloon or a piladean missile defense system) has the ability to completely incapacitate the anomalist&rsquo;s ability to see what&rsquo;s really there. Carl Sagan once said that &ldquo;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&rdquo;, but that is no more an excuse for pseudoskepticism than it is for woo: the anomalist seeks what evidence exists, and if the anomalist is handicapped by a need to see something either more or less extraordinary than that which is there, who will find such evidence?</p>

<p>A demonstration of a script I wrote to generate music from cellular automata. The sounds in the background are the &lsquo;music&rsquo; generated by this run. The initial states of all the agents are randomized, and the ruleset is similar to that used by otomata. The sounds themselves are synthesized using sox.</p>

<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2009/11/premature-enlightenment-and-faith-of-no.html">Premature Enlightenment and the Faith of No-Faith</a></h2>
<p><span>The initial Promethean enlightenment philosophy was radical; it has now become the status quo. As Crowley described, the spread of even the best ideas will grow </span><a href="http://dailygrail.com/features/the-myth-of-james-randis-million-dollar-challenge">batches of charlatans who have poor understanding and merely preach the faith</a><span>, in this case the faith of no-faith &ndash; a rising form of pseudoskepticism whose dogma is based on an assumption of stasis in science that is in of itself illusory and self-contradictory.</span><br/><br/><span>Whenever you depart from the radical &ndash; the quick progression of ideas, and the violent changes both mental and environmental that come with it &ndash; you become an institution and furthermore static. An organization that has calcified can no longer be radical, and that which was once dangerously progressive has become conservative and reactionary. This is the heart of my understanding of progress &ndash; that it leaves any snapshot of itself quickly in the dust. Neal Stephenson had a nice geological metaphor for it in </span><u>In The Beginning&hellip; Was The Command Line</u><span>. The point stands that those who marry the spirit of their age soon become widowers &ndash; or, in many cases, far worse: they become the delusional Norman Bates, married to the corpse of the culture that birthed them and willing to kill those who dare endanger their warped rear-view mirror.</span><br/><br/><span>How could this have happened? The age of reason has been declared far too soon &ndash; but Voltaire failed to realize that perhaps the thing holding Reason back was the very worship of Reason. Early enlightenment thinking was agnostic &ndash; thank Jefferson for the way that was passed on into early United States legislation, and by extension many of the similar documents that were modeled after it. Over time, though, the twin cores of Prometheanism &ndash; &ldquo;Nobody knows&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out&rdquo; &ndash; were separated. The former was largely the victim of the ever-present human ego, which appears to be the largest factor (outside of a tendency for baldness and a terribly acrobatic vocal tract) separating us from the other apes; we forteans and other beautiful mutants were by and large the takers of agnosis, since it scares even the most forward-thinking of those who prefer to live in the past and tends to be considered a sign of weakness by the ones who still think throwing shit is a good way to solve problems (some shit is written, some is spoken, some is lead, and now we also have nuclear shit &ndash; the purpose remains the same, though: put it down to lay claim to territory, and throw it at whoever dares trespass). The latter was pursued doubletime, but was somewhat useless in many cases seeing as people tend to get supporting evidence for things they already know, regardless of whether or not it is true &ndash; it was perhaps a mismeasure of man to assume he could be objective.</span><br/><br/><span>Well, now that the clergy is firmly in place and the pious populous is supporting the saints and the cardinals, we can firmly expect the heretics and the theologians (which set contains the other?) to be locked up in monasteries. Perhaps a new hermeticism is needed; an alchemy of revolutionary agnosticism where reason is more tempered. We all know that when the village is global, everyone in the monastery and the trivium alike will pick the short line &ndash; a socially constructed reality, enforced by faith: the faith that we have no faith, and need none, and that our work will lead to the elimination of faith and agnosis alike.</span><br/><br/><span>Hey, Mister Architect: You&rsquo;re number one!</span></p>

<h2>Another rant about skepticism</h2>
<p>Opposing homeopathy (or opposing some arbitrary other specific idea at odds with evidence) does not constitute skepticism. While skeptics tend to side with evidence against blind faith, coincidentally siding with evidence is not the same as systematically siding with evidence. A lot of self-proclaimed skeptics aren&rsquo;t actually skeptical at all; they just have a decent track record by siding with the majority opinion of a relatively educated subculture, as opposed to actually actively questioning their own beliefs (a fundamental part of skepticism). They are not fundamentally more skeptical than the members of a less educated culture that have blind faith in those things &lsquo;skeptics&rsquo; rail against.</p>
<p>Neither is disbelief skepticism. One who believes that the moon is not real is not in fact a skeptic; he&rsquo;s just kind of strange. Just because you don&rsquo;t believe in something doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re skeptical of it. One is only skeptical when one&rsquo;s belief or disbelief is cemented in evidence. One who disbelieves in a thing because there is no evidence for or against it isn&rsquo;t skeptical; he&rsquo;s just a bit dim, and wouldn&rsquo;t pass a class in formal logic.</p>

<p>Charles Fort was far more of a skeptic than Dawkins will ever be.</p>

<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2010/05/culture-bomb.html">Culture Bomb</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_qYmHzGcNhZ8/S_SnUVUNORI/AAAAAAAAAD4/KlQV_jfwwIU/s1600/bowman.png"><br/><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5473183414923114770" src="../media/bowman.png"/></a><br/><em><strong><br/>NB:</strong> this was mined with minimal changes from <a href="http://irreality.me/x/res/427.html">a thread</a></em><br/><br/><span>I may or may not have come up with this idea. I suspect I may have stolen it from GM through crypomnesia, prediction, wanking, following the same line of thought, or quantum telepathy dongs.</span><br/><br/><span>You all might be aware of the idea of memebombs. I frame memebombs in a slightly different structure than the Discordian Power Elite (whoever they are), so I&rsquo;ll summarize my model: you&rsquo;ve got at least one memeplex (a bunch of ideas that play nice together) and one of them is probably dominant most of the time. A memebomb is a short slogan that targets common dominant memeplexes and subverts them in such a way that they either self-annihilate, become patently absurd, or mutate into something else entirely (ideally). You more or less want to target a memeplex and get behind its defenses, and then poke it until it explodes, loses an eye, or grows a new eye. In the BIP metaphor, a memebomb blows up a wall, leaving shrapnel everywhere to use for remodeling.</span><br/><br/><span>Alright. But there are a couple problems with memebombs. One problem is that, being short slogans, one can recognize them for what they are more often and just block them out. Another is that they only target one memeplex &ndash; if you hit the dominant one, the next most dominant will probably try to take over, and if you hit a non-dominant one it may just give the others more power over the behavior of the person. Three, there&rsquo;s only so much distribution it can get before being subverted itself. Four, the form tends to make people think that anything short and clever-sounding counts as a memebomb, which is why the SOMA is full of dreck.</span><br/><br/><span>Alright. So, what&rsquo;s a culture bomb? Well, a culture is more or less a whole ecosystem of memeplexes fed to children (and adults). A culture is somewhat like a genre in fiction &ndash; a set of cliched yet not necessarily negative or counterfactual tropes (in this case, ideology or psychology tropes) that are often found together more or less for hysterical rasins (tradition or whatever). A culture bomb is the nonfiction equivalent of a deconstructor fleet, and the memebomb equivalent of a kiloton nuke full of anthrax and mercury. The culture bomb is a full work of fiction disguised as a genre piece that, hypersigil-like, subverts or mutates entire aspects of the culture of the target audience only after the reader has had enough time to finish it, chew on it, and recommend it to friends.</span><br/><br/><span>There are several possible media for culture bombs. I&rsquo;ll suggest a few I&rsquo;m considering, along with pros and cons.</span><br/><br/><span>American comics</span><br/><span>Pro: absurdly rich source of material to play with, some established names who might play along, already the home of plenty of successful hypersigils both accidental and on purpose</span><br/><span>Con: difficult to get in on, big names (big red arrow pointing to you), still kinda fringe, ascended fanboys at the gates</span><br/><br/><span>Fanfiction</span><br/><span>Pros: subverts an existing canon and promulgates your ideas in fanon if you&rsquo;re lucky, easy access to a reasonably wide audience, relative anonymity</span><br/><span>Cons: thirteen year old girls aren&rsquo;t exactly the pinnacle of society, ideas may mutate to subvert your original intent or just sterilize it in derivative works, you need to be a fan to start out with, you have to write actually good fanfiction, anne rice might sue you</span><br/><br/><span>Webcomics</span><br/><span>Pros: potentially huge audience, easily time-segmented so that people can be brought into the fold by fans before the intent is even fulfilled, potentially madly obsessive fans</span><br/><span>Cons: may be even less mainstream than american comics, you need to be able to draw probably, everyone else had the same idea too after they made their blog and wiki and joined twitter</span><br/><br/><span>Imageboard:</span><br/><span>Pro: tendency towards high-frequency high-feedback communication within an imageboard can refine ideas</span><br/><span>Con: tendency towards high-frequency high-feedback communication within an imageboard can subvert and/or sterilize intent, tldr responses</span><br/><br/><span>Bonus: the idea of a culturebomb might itself be a culturebomb if introduced in the right context. I&rsquo;m planning to work it into a later chapter of a story.</span><br/><br/><span>You might consider a number of existing phenomena (historically) to be culturebombs. In fact, particular ideas have drastically modified the cultures from which they were born, in absurd and unpredictable ways.</span><br/><br/><span>Examples:</span><br/><span>* Nuclear weapons &ndash; caused the cold war, the idea of mutually assured destruction, deterrent-based warfare, &ldquo;purity of essence&rdquo;</span><br/><span>* The holy trinity &ndash; people can be monotheists and polytheists simultaenously by not knowing how to count, a man can be his own son and a ghost at the same time</span><br/><span>* Darwinian natural selection &ndash; led to memetics, was used as an excuse by businessmen and nazis, caused some groups of creationists to ask very strange questions about monkeys</span><br/><br/><span>Any piece of good art can be considered a culturebomb to some extent, but culturebombs are more often accidental. This might be because people are bad at making them on purpose, or it might be because people weren&rsquo;t thinking about them in a way that&rsquo;s conducive to making them. It might also be because no one wants to make them.</span></p>

<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2010/06/infictive-infections-and-working.html">Infictive Infections and Working Subversions</a></h2>
<p><span>An </span><a href="http://chaosmarxism.blogspot.com/2009/02/im-goddamned-batman.html">excellent post</a><span> by Deloras at Chaos Marxism has sparked </span><a href="http://irreality.me/x/res/1276.html">much</a><span></span><a href="http://irreality.me/x/res/1354.html">discussion</a><span>, and I suppose I should probably expand and clarify my $0.02 on the subject.</span><br/><br/><span>We live mostly not in reality, but in fictional projections of our models of reality. Whenever we make a conscious decision, we are consulting models of reality formed from several sources of information:</span><br/><span>1) previous direct experience in analogous situations</span><br/><span>2) indirect experience of analogous situations (stories)</span><br/><span>3) the interaction between existing models and new experiences (received directly or indirectly) </span><em>as they interacted at the time of absorption</em><br/><br/><span>Now, our models occasionally reject direct experience that conflicts completely with our models. This is useful; our sense organs produce spurious noise much of the time, and so it is very important in a life-or-death situation to have the kind of brain function that will tell you that the shape in the corner of the room is NOT a ghost or a shroud-eater or some even-scarier beast you have been raised to think does not exist, since otherwise you may run into the mouth of a more immediate danger while fleeing a chimera. The veto mechanism can be abused, as is seen in practice by many highly dogmatic systems of thought (obvious examples include the creationists, the Randites, the Randiites, the lifestyle canon-marxists, apple fans, microsoft fans, linux fans, breatharians, and fluffybunny pagan types, but pretty much any subculture with a name consists partially if not mostly of people who will ignore reality that conflicts with their pet models).</span><br/><br/><span>There are other ways these systems can be hacked, though. Robert Anton Wilson&rsquo;s epistemological pan-agnosticism, </span><a href="http://chaosmarxism.blogspot.com/2009/08/cleavage.html">like some less-metaphorical Neo, tries to save people from their own nervous system firewalls by demonstrating how much nonsense they can generate</a><span>. Unfortunately, dogmatic memeplexes have some pretty intense and potent self-defense systems. </span><a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4677263347_d7f56ee6a0_o.jpg">Cognitive dissonance may not be a good route either.</a><span> While I am all for people freeing their minds, a grass-roots free-your-mind movement is probably destined for as much success as the </span><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Yippieflag.gif/200px-Yippieflag.gif">yippie movement&rsquo;s grassroots free-your-mind movement</a><span>; trickle-up enlightenment is likely to be blocked subconsciously by the memeplexes that have already infiltrated the highest levels of society. On the other hand, </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing#Notable_examples">the most active adepts in today&rsquo;s world</a><span> </span><a href="http://chaosmarxism.blogspot.com/2009/09/o-wad-some-power-giftie-gie-us.html">have already realized how to get people to suspend disbelief</a><span> long enough to feed them </span><a href="http://picturebook.nothingness.org/pbook/mrblock/display/1">autotoxic memeplexes</a><span>.</span><br/><br/><span>Everyone partakes of fiction, more or less. Fiction provides </span><a href="http://tvtropes.org/">a language in which the shorthand forms of the everyday umwelt can be slipped to the uninitiated</a><span>, and designed in such a way that subversions should slip under the radar. All communication is subversion in a sense, and the spectacle can be infected in such a way that it will promote the manipulation of reality tunnels. Like any other living creature, the spectacle will do anything to survive, or die trying. </span><a href="http://www.infictive.com/index.php?title=Where_The_Name_Comes_From">The infectious detournment of fiction made possible by the extensive classification by tropers of the sub-liminal language of modern narrative will not only affect fiction but affect reality</a><span>.</span><br/><br/><span>There are side notes to this, which might be best explored later. I will note them now:</span><br/><span>1) One can utilize tvtropes outside of the standard narrative hypersigil workings, since these documents show correlations between entities, qualities, and rituals, as understood under the radar by the hoi polloi.</span><br/><span>2) Fiction affects reality through methods not directly mediated by humans. The most obvious example is google-bombing, which on a much more subtle level any piece of fiction that is archived by a search engine as sophisticated as google&rsquo;s will end up doing to some extent &ndash; slightly modifying the results of searches, ad targeting, and even translations.</span><br/><span>3) TvTropes itself is highly mutable. Any tvtropes-inspired subversion that gains notability will eventually modify tvtropes itself, and even non-notable narratives can subvert pieces of the narrative spectacle.</span></p>

<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2010/11/nobody-likes-golden-age.html">Nobody Likes a Golden Age</a></h2>
<p><span>If ideas spread like viruses, pop-culture is like those freezers that the CDC keeps full of plague bacteria. The past is full of interesting sights and sounds&hellip; most of the time. Some of the most information-rich stuff is </span><a href="http://hilobrow.com/2010/06/05/camp-kitsch-cheese/">camp material</a><span>, but not for the reasons you might think. Camp material is bizarre, which means that it&rsquo;s novel &ndash; </span><a href="http://enki2.tumblr.com/post/1552741065/novelty">and novelty, you should remember, is information</a><span>. But, camp is unique in that it&rsquo;s bizarre now but wasn&rsquo;t bizarre when it was most popular. Camp is full of information that was once relatively ubiquitous but has since been lost to time; it grows organically out of the most volatile and virile ideas, and represents a snapshot of a mutation of normalcy.</span><br/><br/><span>When you look at any &lsquo;golden age&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll see some of its ideas all around you. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s golden: it had an inordinate quantity of good (or at least sustainable) ideas. Golden ages also tend to be (or tend to portray themselves as being, or tend to be portrayed as being) happy times. All together, this makes golden ages boring. There is no camp; there is merely an overflow of kitsch and cheese. Camp is spontaneously creative as a baseline; like the flu, it conquers half the population regardless of immunizations, disappears after a few weeks, and then comes back in a nearly unrecognizable new strain the following year. Cheese, on the other hand, lacks the soul and vitality; it is merely dated kitsch, and ages far slower. Happy (or rather, contented) people don&rsquo;t feel the need to replace their stable status quo with </span><a href="http://www.everythingisterrible.com/2010/11/destory-all-movies-lesson-1-overview-or.html">the kind of destructive fashions that mutate into camp</a><span>. While some 'golden ages&rsquo; have, due to historical events causing sudden shifts in the perception of acceptability attributed to the ideas from which they sprung, become camp material (</span><a href="http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1988/1/1988_1_34.shtml">the golden age of science fiction in the 1930s comes to mind</a><span>, </span><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Comics_Code_Authority#1954_Code_highlights">as does the golden age of comics</a><span>), as a rule they become as boring as the reign of Augustus.</span><br/><br/><span>Is it worth it? People are happy (or, at least, content). Things are stable.</span><br/><br/><span>But, in addition to boring the living hell out of whoever is reading about them, golden ages typically bring bunkum to the table aside from new (for the period) status quos and zombie-twinkie-kitsch that won&rsquo;t die. The creation of a system that isn&rsquo;t replaced for a thousand years can be interpreted as the creation of a good, stable system that 'just works&rsquo;, or it can be interpreted as the creation of a system that, regardless of how good it is, manages to stifle competition and brings a thousand years of stagnation in that area when ten will do.</span></p>

<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2010/12/zalgo-continuum.html">The Zalgo Continuum</a></h2>
<p>Presumably, you have all heard of ZALGO, the 4chan meme (or out-of-control viral marketing test project) who<u> l<strong>u</strong><sup>rk</sup><sub>s beh</sub><em>i</em><strong>n<em>d t<sup>he wa</sup><sub>l</sub></em>l</strong>s</u> has been making the rounds for quite some time. The popularity of internet memes is difficult to attribute, but I will make the argument that this one has survived because it neatly integrates two other long-lived ideas: the cosmic horror and the cosmic schmuck.</p>
<p>Cosmic horror (and its poster-thing, H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s posthumous flagship Cthulu) has seen an upshot in popularity lately, perhaps piggybacking on uncertain times or future shock or the generally negative social and political vibes floating around. Whatever the reason, analysts (including Lovecraft himself) generally agree on one thing: cosmic horror derives its power not from the uncanny or from the unknown but from the unknowable. Cosmic horror is a recollectivisation of existential angst: not only are you insignificant (everyone is) and your actions meaningless (everything is), but there are things just beyond your reach that are so utterly alien and incomprehensible that they can destroy your mind just by daring to think about them. Not only that, but even on their much higher scale of existence they too are insignificant and their actions meaningless. Furthermore, cosmic horror is epistemic horror: each of the scholar-protagonists, after great efforts, briefly part the veil of Maya and have a short peek out of Plato&rsquo;s cave, and they quickly realize that everything they ever knew (and everything they ever could know) is wrong. Cosmic horror is, to the individual, what quantum mechanics and relativity were to the entirety of theoretical physics: a fundamental paradigm shift so extreme that it invalidated all bodies of speculation into its domain that had previously existed.</p>
<p>On the flipside, you have the cosmic schmuck. This idea, put forth first (as far as I can tell) by Robert Anton Wilson, is a bit more lighthearted. The cosmic schmuck has a completely wrong model of the universe, unknowingly. He doesn&rsquo;t know that his model is wrong because he hasn&rsquo;t tested the parts of it that are wrong. His quality of life may or may not be affected by the way in which his model of the universe is skewed, but he can&rsquo;t determine that because he doesn&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s skewed. The cosmic schmuck can become less of a cosmic schmuck by assuming that he is more of a cosmic schmuck than he thinks he is, because the mark of a cosmic schmuck is his unfounded confidence in his own model of reality. While Wilson attends to the aspect of introspective and epistemic terror involved in becoming less of a cosmic schmuck in Cosmic Trigger I, one still gets the general idea that becoming less of a cosmic schmuck is a good idea &ndash; and presumably it was for Wilson, since he survived it with much of his sanity intact and made a pretty penny selling a book based on his experiences in seeking the Real Shit (which he insists is both plural and mutable).</p>
<p>Zalgo, given its origins (or at least the petri dish from which it eventually sprang, after a long incubation period), is firmly grounded in humour. It is more specifically grounded in what Wilson called the &lsquo;put-on&rsquo;, and what the internet calls 'trolling&rsquo;. The creepypasta, taking copious obvious inspiration from cosmic horror and the Lovecraft style, purports to be true, or at least honest. Those who take it seriously (I am not sure there are many cases of this level of fail, Doctor) are prime subjects for ridicule, or at least identifiable as good targets for more put-ons. Those who pick up on it can play along or repeat the gag in another context. But, arguably, this meme has a ha-ha-only-serious nature embedded in the subtext. Cosmic horror is here in a far more pure form than that of your standard Lovecraft tie-in, and arguably in even more pure a form than the original works, which were still put forth in bindings marked 'fiction&rsquo;. The Strange Times are upon us, and it is increasingly difficult to determine whether or not any given thing popping up on the internet is plausible, let alone legitimate. Zalgo reminds us that just beyond our mundane sphere of attention lurks things so alien that we cannot imagine them, and that even our most cherished icons of purity are not safe from the unknown and unknowable.</p>

<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2011/06/ramblings-novelty-identity-teleology.html">Novelty, Teleology, Identity</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://namcub.accela-labs.com/pics/AnonymousFlame.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://namcub.accela-labs.com/pics/AnonymousFlame.jpg"/></a><br/><span>The Eliza Effect is the tendency to anthropomorphize those artifacts that present humanlike qualities shallowly. I have studied this effect in practice quite a bit, in an uncontrolled way, and discovered that in the context of markov chain bots (which learn by developing markov models, and as such adopt the manner of speech of those it speaks to) those people whose manner of speech is closest to that of the bot are the most likely to feel empathy with the bot &ndash; a situation that should not be surprising, given the use of word patterns and vocabulary in forming social groupings (and, of course, the so-called Babel Effect).</span><br/><br/><span>Now, in humans, interest corresponds to novelty not entirely straightforwardly. Something that is interesting has not too little and not too much novelty: too little novelty is too little novelty is too little novelty is too little novelty, and too much novelty is nwiganbowyaionciwyea 893jf, while just enough novelty is the joy of whole milk until sunrise. This is affected somewhat by social concerns, since particular memeplexes encourage neophilia (meaning that a greater amount of novelty meets the sweet spot goldie locks zone of &lsquo;interesting&rsquo;) while others encourage neophobia (meaning that the zone of 'interesting&rsquo; has less novelty). Where 'interesting&rsquo; begins for a neophile is often where 'interesting&rsquo; ends for a neophobe, but novelty depends quite strongly on mental models, so the gap widens quickly.</span><br/><br/><span>As a neophile, I tend to talk of neophilia, but neophilia is not all rainbows and unicorns. Neophilia is potentially dangerous because at a fundamental level is encourages dabbling in the unknown. Neophobes, whatever else they are, are at least as safe as they were last year. Neophiles become more safe only accidentally, because they spend their free time playing with fire. It takes someone who plays a lot with fire to invent fireproof curtains (or rocket science &ndash; and Marvel Parsons probably makes it onto the list of archtypal neophiles for the prometheus element), and once fireproof curtains are invented suddenly the neophobes are safer too. But, we just need to look at what happened to good old Jack to see the danger in neophilia: eaten by living flame.</span><br/><br/><span>Now, if you look at a community (or, really, a superorganism) like Anonymous, you see a lot of deindividuation going on. Anon has no name. Anon&rsquo;s internal communications are clogged with cats, tits, gtfos, and brick-shitting. A perfect petri dish for deindividuation, in other words: lack of identity within the group, highly stimulating sensory input, and at a high frequency. One other thing that is certainly true of Anon is the high novelty content of communications. There are some old sawhorses here: lolcats have little information per-se, though they can be made to carry much more with clever juxtapositions, and most image macros are content free. However, the image macro has the potential (sometimes realized) to be a highly potent capsule of information: it is easy to transmit (cock and repost), highly stimulating at best, has the potential for the same message to be introduced in several ways (both text and images, which can interact again with existing idioms both verbal and visual), and is part of a conditioning loop that encourages spread (all the forums I&rsquo;ve been on since 2004 have had at least one thread for posting interesting images, most of which are clogged with macros, and macros are certainly very popular on tumblr and twitter).</span><br/><br/><br/><span>Once again, though, we must separate intended meaning with interpreted meaning. Plenty of accepted meanings were never intended, which is fine because the protocol of natural languages is loose and ambiguous. Many of the idioms attributed to Anon clearly began accidentally, as a look at memebase will demonstrate. Even the silliest of these idioms have the potential to be repurposed to say something decidedly important, or at least 'interesting&rsquo;. Many of them have. These idioms have made their way into mainstream news through the releases of LulzSec, for instance, which says fairly serious things in fairly silly ways (Eric S Raymond calls this 'Ha Ha Only Serious&rsquo;), and makes extensive use of the idioms generally attributed to Anon.</span><br/><br/><span>A machine could probably fairly trivially pass as human on various imageboards. It could repost images, write its own messages. It would become nearly invisible because of the sheer frequency with which /b/ moves (and because of the sheer glaciality with which some of the other imageboards move). It would mashup existing memes, and some of the mashed memes may gain a following. It would not be kicked out because it is not a spam bot. It would have an extensive archive of images and an extensive model of conversation. Once it begins to be accepted as clearly human (it has a hat) its word model could slowly be infiltrated, with new text introduced. It might mix and match lolcat speech with Karl Marx or with E. E. Cummings, or with Dylan Thomas, or with Ken Kesey. It might be a force to popularize the phrase 'on the gripping hand&rsquo;. It would be an interesting experiment.</span><br/><br/><span>It is not worthwhile for one person to do it. That would not be even-handed. If you want to do it, please do so, and release your results when you finish. Ideally, more than six or seven people would do this at once, introducing entirely different texts of their choosing. Bots learn fast, but adapt slow. It may take a few months for Das Kapital to even subtly infiltrate Rage Guy. But, I have a sneaking suspicion that such an introduction will have a much more far-reaching affect on the superorganism than any conscious attempt to use humans to influence it, since it will get past mental defenses.</span></p>

<h2>Kerouac vs Hesse</h2>
<p>When you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water. Somewhere along the line I knew there&rsquo;d be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me.<br/><br/>A true seeker cannot not accept any teachings, not if he sincerely wishes to find something. I hid in the grapevines, digging it all. I felt like a million dollars; I was adventuring in the crazy American night. The potential Buddha already exists in the sinner; his future is already there.<br/><br/>Words do not express thoughts very well. They always become a little different immediately after they are expressed, a little distorted, a little foolish. We fumed and screamed in our mountain nook, mad drunken Americans in the mighty land. We were on the roof of America and all we could do was yell, I guess — across the night, eastward over the Plains.<br/><br/>During deep meditation it is possible to dispel time, to see simultaneously all the past, present, and future, and then everything is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman. We turned at a dozen paces, for love is a duel, and looked at each other for the last time.<br/><br/>Here is a doctrine at which you will laugh. It seems to me that Love is the most important thing in the world. We were already almost out of America and yet definitely in it and in the middle of where it&rsquo;s maddest. I think it is only important to love the world, to explain and despise it. But we should regard the world and ourselves and all beings with love, admiration and respect. Boys and girls in America have such a sad time together; sophistication demands that they submit to sex immediately without proper preliminary talk. Not courting talk — real straight talk about souls, for life is holy and every moment is precious.<br/><br/>I had to strive for property and experience nausea and the depths of despair in order to learn not to resist them, in order to learn to love the world, and no longer compare it with some kind of desired imaginary world, some imaginary vision of perfection, but to leave it as it is, to love it and be glad to belong to it. Whither goest thou, America, in thy shiny car in the night?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><em>words by Hesse &amp; Kerouac</em><br/><em>arranged by Cramulus &amp; Zarathud</em></p>

<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2012/02/two-unexpected-varieties-of-synthesis.html">Two Unexpected Varieties of Synthesis</a></h2>
<p><span>OWS has been analyzed a lot, recently. I hope to apply to it some fresh ideas, by comparing it to Maker culture (a comparison that has not been made so far as I am aware).</span><br/><br/><span>First off, a bit of background. For those not familiar with Marxist theory, a synthesis is the end result of two opposing cultural forces (thesis and antithesis). Each synthesis becomes the thesis or antithesis for some later synthesis. It is this model of a cultural dialectic that led Marx to believe that his conception of communism was inevitable &ndash; something that is demonstrably untrue (his conception of communism has, as of yet, not even been attempted &ndash; though plenty of people and groups apply the term &lsquo;Marxist&rsquo; to their own pet projects). The antithesis Marx was concerned with was the alienated workers: specifically, the working poor who could no longer comprehend nor afford the products of their labor, creeping Taylorism chopping their assigned tasks into smaller and smaller super-specialized subroutines.</span><br/><br/><span>In a sense, both OWS and Maker culture are syntheses of worker alienation and capitalism. OWS is the more traditional of the two: a protest movement with a hint of stale Situationism, it is at its core a kind of solidarity-centric replay of medieval acetic movements, and dangerous for the same reasons. Maker culture is arguably more constructive: the old anarcho-punk DIY culture with all the external trappings of political discontent and blood-in-tooth-and-nail stripped away, it is in a sense even more dangerous to the establishment, because while retaining an ostensible capitalist element it promotes the idea of </span><em>distributing</em><span> the means of production rather than </span><em>seizing</em><span>it.</span><br/><br/><span>Both of these are major threats to </span><em>consumerism</em><span> &ndash; as opposed to</span><em>capitalism</em><span>, which is not necessarily the same thing. Neither of these movements run counter to capitalism per-se. OWS is concerned with money and its distribution, which puts it firmly in line with pseudo-Marxist statist movements of the past and present (such as those leading to the Soviet Union and modern China, those stalwart encouraging symbols of state-central capitalism shrouded in a cloak of pseudo-Communist babble that told the western world that the Marxists aren&rsquo;t so different at all) &ndash; at its most extreme, it is a</span><em>socialist</em><span> movement that seeks to juggle the green paper around such that there isn&rsquo;t such an extreme difference between the powers (social, political, and material) in the hands of the exceedingly wealthy (who &ndash; remember &ndash; are now more capable of venturing into outer space than the ESA, and maybe even NASA) and the exceedingly poor (who cannot necessarily feed themselves with the money provided by the government, on account of pricing policies designed to fleece those who cannot afford to travel very far to buy their bread and milk). An evening out of these powers would abolish the middle class as an entity by clumping everyone together in a single middle class, ending consumerism but not conspicuous consumerism (let alone capitalism, which only the obsolescence of money can practically abolish).</span><br/><br/><span>On the other hand, the Maker movement is in a sense far more radical. Living within the bubble of consumerism, this movement is focused largely on tools to make tools &ndash; in some cases automatically. The holy grail, even now, is affordable automatic manufacturing of a variety of objects. Currently, the best contenders in this category are minimally affordable, minimally automatic, and minimally various (a 3d printer costs a bit over a thousand dollars, can print enough of a copy of itself to shave five hundred dollars off of a replica of itself for fifty dollars worth of materials provided one is willing to go through quite a bit of assembly and tweaking, and with extensive modification can produce volumetric solids from several varieties of plastics, chocolate, and wax; some attempts at using other materials have met with limited success, but electronics require a totally separate system, and any material that requires subtractive rather than additive forming requires a CNC mill instead). However, progress is certainly being made: a few decades ago, J. Random Luser could not expect to be able to afford a CNC, but now he can keep a CNC and a 3d printer in his garage and operate them on weekends. It will cost him as much as a brand new computer might have cost him in 1990, and he can use that computer he bought in 1990 to control the devices. The threat to consumerism is clear: J. Random Luser does not need to spend money in order to participate in conspicuous consumerism; he certainly doesn&rsquo;t need to shop the commodity market for the external trappings of an identity, now that he can download a car off The Pirate Bay and run it off the printer while he&rsquo;s at work, put it together on weekends as a project with the kids. It&rsquo;s no post-scarcity society, but it&rsquo;s a society where the artificial scarcity of commodities cannot be maintained (just as widespread internet access made the artificial scarcity of media unmaintainable &ndash; though don&rsquo;t tell the RIAA that).</span><br/><br/><span>Nevertheless, these are both the result of the white collar alienation described in J. G. Ballard's </span><u>The Millennium People</u><span>, not the blue collar alienation of the working poor covered by Marx. The working poor cannot afford a 3d printer. The working poor cannot afford to take time off to camp out in tents in public parks (though the non-working poor &ndash; homeless who are not suitable to be hired and who cannot get government assistance on account of having no permanent address; the people who might have broken shop windows in the 30s to get into jail and join one of the two classes in America with guaranteed food, shelter, and health care &ndash; can indeed afford to join the protesters in their Hoovervilles). What synthesis do we see in the working poor? Certainly not socialist solidarity!</span><br/><br/><span>The attempts by the free market to disabuse the working poor of the notion that all those things socialism brought to the European working poor (minimum wage, unionization, health care, government assistance) are evil has been more or less successful in the United States, where (as is attributed to Vincent Price) &ldquo;the working poor see themselves as temporarily embarrassed potential millionaires&rdquo;. Of course, this tension between True Belief and Stark Reality will not find its synthesis in some kind of sensible policy decision or effective practical application. As with other forms of cognitive dissonance, the appropriate response is a retreat into apocalyptic fantasy: the religious right reigns in the economically downtrodden middle-America just as the religious right reigns in war-torn Afghanistan (both in the Taliban &ndash; the charismatic religious conservatives of the Muslim world &ndash; and in those sent in to fight them&hellip; too bad only Neal Stephenson characters and BBC documentary producers appear to realize the similarities). Those with enough opium sink into a haze and ignore the bombs outside.</span><br/><br/><span>What&rsquo;s a little shocking is that it seems like nobody (aside from Cory Doctorow, who could be credited with inventing makers instead) predicted either of these.</span></p>

<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2012/03/rant.html">A Rant</a></h2>
<p><span>It&rsquo;s 2012. Our cars do not fly, are not self-driving, and are powered by fire.</span><br/><br/><span>Even though there were personal robots in the american consumer market in the 1980s capable of:</span></p>
<blockquote>1) Speech recognition (including voice authentication *and* voice command)<br/>2) Goal-oriented programming<br/>3) Real-time procedural generation of original narratives<br/>4) Fairly nuanced navigation and area-mapping, including self-charging, without vision or navigation beacons</blockquote>
<p><span>the most advanced personal robot on the american consumer market at the moment (barring kit robots like PINO and the PR-2) is the Pleo, which has support for only #4.</span><br/><br/><span>Our computers almost universally depend upon a user interface invented in the early 1970s by XEROX and popularized in 1984 &ndash; a user interface now so common that people feel as though no other user interface is possible.</span><br/><br/><span>No one has been on the moon since 1971.</span><br/><br/><span>The space shuttle is limited to the technology that existed when it was designed (with some exceptions, provided interoperability) in the early 1970s. As a result, at the time of the program&rsquo;s closure, the space shuttle computers still used core memory.</span><br/><br/><span>The general design adhered to by tablet computers was created initially by the dynabook project in 1968, and variants on it can be seen in Star Trek: The Next Generation.</span><br/><br/><span>The much-advertised SIRI is based loosely on an SRI AI project of the same name. However, Apple&rsquo;s version is not significantly more complex than Eliza or ALICE.</span><br/><br/><span>In 1997, the World Wide Web was clearly a simulation of paper under glass, with the occasional hyperlink or animated GIF for distraction. In 2012, most of the web is still clearly a simulation of paper under glass, but elaborate hacks involving abuse of self-modifying code and incredible wastes of bandwidth trick some fraction of the web into instead poorly simulating the 1970s XEROX user interface inside of itself.</span><br/><br/><span>In the 1980s, Steve Mann invented a wearable computer that could detect billboards and replace their content with content of his choice. In the early 1990s, the MIT Media Lab worked on a wearable computer that was context-aware and selectively gave reminders and suggestions via subliminal text display when a complete focus shift would not be advisable. In 2012, Google announced that it would work on a wearable computer project, hiring people from the 1990s MIT Media Lab wearable computer projects. Judging from other Android devices and Google&rsquo;s other products, this augmented reality project seems like it will probably involve inserting advertisements where none previously existed, rather than removing them (as Steve Mann&rsquo;s device did).</span><br/><br/><span>Whether or not a hyperlink is broken on the web still relies entirely upon the maintenance of the page pointed to, despite all hypertext projects prior to the 1992 Berners-Lee project having solved this problem. Hyperlinks on the web still point to whole pages, or at best single points within pages (given the foresight of the original author to place labels at appropriate points), whereas some pre-1992 hypertext projects supported bidirectional links between spans of content (including multiple overlapping links).</span><br/><br/><span>The portable digital music player was invented in the mid-70s. Aside from major storage increases and the occasional feature like video support, portable digital music players have remained largely unchanged in design.</span><br/><br/><span>In 1978, a brain-computer interface allowed a blind man to see with the use of a low-resolution digital camera. In 2002, sixteen other subjects had the treatment. It is still not commercially available.</span><br/><br/><span>Between 1966 and 1972, MIT developed a mobile robot named SHAKEY that was capable of goal-based reasoning, route planning, environment mapping, obstacle avoidance, object detection, and limited forms of object manipulation.</span><br/><br/><span>In 1982, a patent was filed on the use of optical fibers as bend sensors. This was used in a number of &lsquo;wired gloves&rsquo;, which use bend sensors and accelerometers to report the state of hand movements to a computer. In 1987, Nintendo commercialized a product similar to these devices as the PowerGlove. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a device used by people who could not afford a PowerGlove (or its more technically advanced brethren), which took the form of a hollowed-out 8-ball full of accelerometers with several buttons on the bottom and a couple infrared beacons. This technology was revived recently as the WiiMote (with the infrared beacons moved to the 'sensorbar&rsquo; and the cable removed).</span><br/><br/><span>In 1991, HP released the HP95LX. It was the size of a modern PDA, had the capabilities of a (low end) stock PC, and ran a stock version of MS-DOS off ROM. It is possible to run Windows 3.x on these.</span><br/><br/><span>In 1990, NewTek released the Video Toaster, a piece of hardware that (when attached to a Commodore Amiga) allowed consumers to perform linear video editing, including real time 3d animation.</span><br/><br/><span>In short, there are a lot of very cool ideas that have not been implemented, have not been commercialized, or have not been commercially successful. Some of them are very old but still very cool. All of them are still possible. Remember this the next time you are trying to choose between Drupal and Ruby on Rails for your social networking site for iguanas.</span></p>
