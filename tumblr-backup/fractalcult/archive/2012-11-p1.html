<p>We’re in the age of Bureaucracy, and my pineal gland is telling me that we are not too far from the age of aftermath.</p>
<p>I’m excited. I’m on the edge of my seat. Because before we can get to the more pleasant Chaos and Discord, things have to fall apart in a big way.</p>
<p>The Goddess prevails and all that!</p>

<p>In a<strong> Fractal Cult Meditation</strong>, you focus on the structural similarities between the small and the large, the internal and the external.</p>
<p>I find it helps to focus your attention on a fractal image, but you don&rsquo;t have to be too picky - fractals are everywhere.</p>
<p>Note the patterns of urban life: they are much like the patterns of the body. The circulatory system brings nutrients to your tissue, just as a street brings customers to a store front. There is a <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyh0poWf1O1r10jfjo1_500.gif">cyclical force</a> which pumps everything along.</p>
<p>That force feels like <em>action</em>, then rest. <em>Action</em>, then rest. <em>Action</em>, then rest&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Work</em>, weekend, <em>work</em>, weekend, <em>work</em>, weekend&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Green light</em>, red light, g<em>reen light</em>, red light, g<em>reen light</em>, red light&hellip; </p>
<p>Sometimes it sounds like this: &ldquo;<em>thesis</em>, antithesis, <em>synth</em>esis&hellip; <em>thesis</em>, antithesis, <em>synth</em>esis&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Lub</em>-dub, <em>lub</em>-dub, <em>lub</em>-dub&hellip;</p>
<p>Fellow explorer, understand this!</p>
<p>The pulse of your body, the pulse of creativity, and the pulse of the city <strong>originate from the same source</strong>. They are echoes of the same rhythm. The only difference is the level of magnification.</p>
<p>You are a cell in the world&rsquo;s body. Relationships are tissue. Organizations are organs. </p>
<p>When something moves you, it&rsquo;s also moving your city, it&rsquo;s also moving the nation, it&rsquo;s also moving the world. </p>
<p>This <em>mysterious pulse</em> manifests differently elsewhere in the fractal. Along the Mandelbrot coastline, all the peninsulas and capes and other protrusions are unique, though structurally similar. </p>
<p>When you experience this connection, you begin to feel the pulse everywhere. Even microscopic experiences during your day carry the full tidal force of the entire cosmos.</p>
<p>You are waiting at a red traffic light.  You sense it&rsquo;s about to turn green. And something inside you takes its foot off the break.</p>
<p>And then the crowd surges forward into the light.</p>

<p><img src="../media/tumblr_me5u3ixECX1r6wxd1.png"/>The <strong>Fractal Cult</strong> is approaching 100 followers, so I figured I&rsquo;d say Hi. So who are we?</p>
<p>FRACTAL CULT is a <a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/31.php">Discordian Cabal</a>. There&rsquo;s about 20 of us. We have little in common, but we are all part of the same fractal. And we&rsquo;re all on the creative trip. AND LATER WE ARE DRINKING KOOL AID TOGETHER.</p>
<p>FRACTAL CULT is a tumblr blog which posts only original content. No reposts unless the content was created by a group member. </p>
<p>If you look closely at FRACTAL CULT, you can see that its parts are made of the whole FRACTAL CULT. </p>
<p>My name is <a href="http://cramulus.tumblr.com">Cramulus</a> and I kicked off this thing because I wanted (a) to discover if there was a Discordian presence on tumblr and (b) if there are Discordians and other spags on tumblr, I wanted to play with them, including &copy; collaboration (d) belonging to a cult, or (e) everybody just do their own thing (f) that&rsquo;s cool too (g) I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll let us leave, and anyway (h) I don&rsquo;t remember what the outside word is like. I suspect there is no outside world anymore. (i) the last frontiers are mental landscapes (j) there is only the umbra which the macrocosm casts upon the microcosm (k) kopyleft all rites reversed hail eris 23 skidoo </p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Pissing on your idea&rdquo;</strong> is the Seth Godin term for when somebody wants to modify your idea before they&rsquo;ll support it. <em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, you just need to change it like this&rdquo;&hellip;</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a dog marking territory.</p>
<p>By changing it, they are investing their ego into the idea. Their hope is that by aligning the idea with their own goals, it becomes more attractive, more worthy of their support.</p>
<p>Seth says: don&rsquo;t sweat it&hellip; If you care about your idea, and you want it to grow, LET people piss on it (if that&rsquo;s what it takes to get their support). <strong>That is how small ideas grow into big ideas, they become everybody&rsquo;s territory.</strong></p>
<p>Robert Anton Wilson also thinks about ideas in terms of territory, but he doesn&rsquo;t romanticize the collaborative process. He agrees that ideas are the current incarnation of territory. All our primate territory-guarding behaviors, hard wired into our nervous system, have been adapted to do battle in a theater of ideas. Many of our conversations are the exact same behavior you see in a junkyard dog barking at strangers who smell like Other territory. Not very romantic, no?</p>
<p>Either way, they agree on this:</p>
<p><strong>Ideas are excrement</strong></p>

<h2>Chao Bellied Sneetches</h2>
<p>Hi guys! Just wanted to give you a quick update about how things are going at <strong>the fractal cult</strong>. It&rsquo;s been &hellip; interesting. About two weeks ago, everybody divided up into camps and moved into the north and south wings of the monastery. It was pretty tense for a while. </p>
<p>Basically, despite this cult being specifically non-religious, everybody here is a <a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/43.php">Discordian Pope</a>. So nobody is under each other&rsquo;s authority, and that creates this oppressive sense of responsibility. Everybody owns the cult. And since they don&rsquo;t want to be associated with anything shitty, they get kind of defensive about it. <em>Crazy</em> defensive.  </p>
<p>There are a lot of creative types here, and apparently that means they have to be expressing themselves all the goddamn time or they&rsquo;ll <em>wilt</em> or something maudlin like that. So after an hour of argument we finally concluded (notice I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;agreed&rdquo;) that we should put on a play. Then, after another hour of argument, we agreed (but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a <em>c</em>onclusion) that we should do <em>The Sneetches</em> by Dr. Seuss.</p>
<p>Everybody was happy. It was a wonderful moment. It was quiet and everybody was smiling. I enjoyed it while it lasted.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the serenity and harmony was decimated by the sound &ldquo;admission fee?&rdquo; passing between somebody&rsquo;s lips. The entire building immediately exploded with flaming shit. There was a huge argument about money and labor and half the cast made a big scene and quit. Then they came back so they could shout more. Eventually this one guy said he&rsquo;d put in all the money and take responsibility for the play, and I guess that solved things, because now he was the Director and everybody calmed down. But only a little.</p>
<p>The Director was excited! He said he wanted to do the costumes this certain way, (Spandex) and a bunch of people flipped the fuck out said they didn&rsquo;t want to be in the play if it had spandex because it will make us look awful and the audience will judge us. The Sneetches had to wear big foam bodysuits which concealed the actor&rsquo;s identity or they&rsquo;d drop out. </p>
<p>The Director got really frustrated because he had basically paid for the thing, and he had always wanted to do a spandex play. Even if some of the cast would look pretty bad in spandex, he thought it would be honest. Somebody said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going to tarnish this Seuss&rsquo; <em>work of art</em> with this amateur regional theater bullshit.&rdquo; That was followed by a wave of groaning and eye rolling. And that&rsquo;s when people started picking sides and moving their stuff into bedrooms on the other side of the Monastery and muttering under their breath all day.</p>
<p>On day two, somebody got peed on.</p>
<p>On day three, somebody was thrown from the balcony and he got a concussion.</p>
<p>Then they peed on him.</p>
<p>On day four, there were peace talks. Except that&rsquo;s a rather generous usage of the word. More accurately, you could call them <em>I have to get this shit off my chest</em> talks. There were tears. Oh there were tears.</p>
<p>At about 11 PM on day four, we reached an agreement to cancel the play and never talk about plays again. Ever.</p>
<p>If this rule was broken, we would all share the punishment: having to go through this entire debacle again.</p>
<p>Somebody took it one step further and said &ldquo;Okay here&rsquo;s an idea. No more group projects. Everybody do your own individual thing, team up with others if you want, but trying to please everybody here is a huge waste of time.&rdquo; Everybody started nodding, that sounds like a good idea, then one guy said &ldquo;<em>Fuck that, you&rsquo;re not the boss of me</em>,&rdquo; and then the shouting started, and totally out of the blue, a stream of hot pee blasted across my cheek, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been holed up in the bathroom with my laptop since yesterday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to hear weird noises outside the door.</p>
<p>No.. Instruments? No no&hellip; LOTS of instruments?? This is fucked up. After all that drama about drama, please tell me we&rsquo;re not starting a big full-cult band.</p>
<p>Please tell me that? </p>
<p>Because seriously&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I have no idea where I left my harmonica.</p>

<h2>It's a Brave New Socialist World</h2>
<p class="MsoPlainText">A Mashup of Aldous Huxley &amp; George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">In Honor of Their Shared Birthday</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Sleep teaching was actually prohibited in England. There was something called liberalism. Parliament, if you know what that was, passed a law against it. The records survive. Speeches about liberty of the subject. Liberty to be inefficient and miserable. Freedom to be a round peg in a square hole.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The imagination cannot conceive a viler criminal than he who should build another London like the present one, nor a greater benefactor than he who should destroy it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">He&rsquo;s so ugly! said Fanny.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">But I rather like his looks.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">And then so small. Fanny made a grimace; smallness was so horribly and typically low-caste.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">I think that&rsquo;s rather sweet, said Lenina. One feels one would like to pet him. You know. Like a cat.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">But, my dear chap, you&rsquo;re welcome, I assure you. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Henry Foster patted the Assistant Predestinator on the shoulder. Every one belongs to every one else, after all.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">One hundred repetitions three nights a week for four years, thought Bernard Marx, who was a specialist on hypnopedia. Sixty-two thousand four hundred repetitions make one truth. Idiots!</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The door not being opened immediately, she rang again, violently, and was presently admitted by a maid, who seemed surprised to see her. Without making any inquiry, she darted upstairs into a drawing-room, where a matron of good presence, with features of the finest Jewish type, sat reading. With her was a handsome boy in black velvet, who said:</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Mamma, here&rsquo;s Henrietta!</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Arthur, said the young lady excitedly, leave the room this instant; and don&rsquo;t dare to come back until you get leave.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The boy&rsquo;s countenance fell, and he sulkily went out without a word.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">In the nurseries, the Elementary Class Consciousness lesson was over, the voices were adapting future demand to future industrial supply. I do love flying, they whispered, I do love flying, I do love having new clothes, I do love&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">We must run away, Hetty, he said. Hold fast about my neck, and don&rsquo;t strangle me. Now then. He lifted her upon his shoulder and ran swiftly through the grounds. When they were stopped by the wall, he placed her atop of it, scrabbled over, and made her jump into his arms. Then he staggered away with her across the fields, gasping out in reply to the inarticulate remonstrances which burst from her as he stumbled and reeled at every hillock, Your weight is increasing at the rate of a stone a second, my love. If you stoop you will break my back. Oh, Lord, here&rsquo;s a ditch!</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Let me down, screamed Henrietta in an ecstasy of delight and apprehension. You will hurt yourself, and&ndash;Oh, DO take&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Liberalism, of course, was dead of anthrax, but all the same you couldn&rsquo;t do things by force.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">There, I&rsquo;m ready, said Lenina, but Fanny remained speechless and averted. Let&rsquo;s make peace, Fanny darling.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Every man, woman and child compelled to consume so much a year. In the interests of industry. The sole result&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches; the more stitches&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">That would be easy to understand. But the strangeness is that I LOVE you and want to go away from you. Not for ever. Only for a time.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">He who desires a lifetime of happiness with a beautiful woman desires to enjoy the taste of wine by keeping his mouth always full of it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">But I don&rsquo;t want you to go away. I won&rsquo;t let you go away, she said, a trace of fierceness mingling with her entreaty.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">One of these days, said Fanny, with dismal emphasis, you&rsquo;ll get into trouble.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Conscientious objection on an enormous scale. Anything not to consume. Back to nature.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">How do I know? I can no more tell you the whys and wherefores of myself than I can lift myself up by the waistband and carry myself into the next county, as some one challenged a speculator in perpetual motion to do. I am too much a pessimist to respect my own affections. Do you know what a pessimist is?</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">A man who thinks everybody as nasty as himself, and hates them for it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">No age or condition is without its heroes. The least incapable general in a nation is its Cæsar, the least imbecile statesman its Solon, the least confused thinker its Socrates, the least commonplace poet its Shakespeare.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Disobedience, the rarest and most courageous of the virtues, is seldom distinguished from neglect, the laziest and commonest of the vices.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">I do love flying. I do love flying.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">My poor Hetty, you don&rsquo;t understand me.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">I only understand that you hate me, and want to go away from me.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Back to culture. Yes, actually to culture. You can&rsquo;t consume much if you sit still and read books.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">You intend to leave me again. I feel it. I know it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">You think you know it because you feel it. Not a bad reason, either.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">In a stupid nation the man of genius becomes a god: everybody worships him and nobody does his will.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Do I look all right? Lenina asked. Her jacket was made of bottle green acetate cloth with green viscose fur; at the cuffs and collar.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Eight hundred Simple Lifers were mowed down by machine guns at Golders Green.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">We admit that when the divinity we worshipped made itself visible and comprehensible we crucified it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Ending is better than mending, ending is better than mending.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Greatness is the secular name for Divinity: both mean simply what lies beyond us.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Green corduroy shorts and white viscose-woolen stockings turned down below the knee.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">She broke into wild exclamations of grief, and he drew her head down and kissed her with a tender action which she could not resist, and a wry face which she did not see.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Then came the famous British Museum Massacre. Two thousand culture fans gassed with dichlorethyl sulphide.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">You only talk that way to frighten me, Sidney; I know you do.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">A green-and-white jockey cap shaded Lenina&rsquo;s eyes; her shoes were bright green and highly polished.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Don&rsquo;t be silly, said Henrietta, smiling vacantly. Then, stung by a half intuition of his meaning, she repulsed him and said angrily, YOU despise ME.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">In the end, said Mustapha Mond, the Controllers realized that force was no good. The slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, neo-Pavlovian conditioning and hypnopedia&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The most intolerable pain is produced by prolonging the keenest pleasure.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">And round her waist she wore a silver-mounted green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt, bulging (for Lenina was not a freemartin) with the regulation supply of contraceptives.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Stop, Sidney. I don&rsquo;t like this sort of romancing. It&rsquo;s all nonsense. DO be nice to me.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">There are stains of sweat on it, I know.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">You nasty wretch!</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">A gentleman of our days is one who has money enough to do what every fool would do if he could afford it: that is, consume without producing.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The discoveries of Pfitzner and Kawaguchi were at last made use of. An intensive propaganda against viviparous reproduction&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Perfect! cried Fanny enthusiastically. She could never resist Lenina&rsquo;s charm for long. And what a perfectly sweet Malthusian belt!</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">What is the use of worrying about it, Sidney? It cannot be helped now. Besides, if your father saved money, and the others were improvident, he deserved to make a fortune.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">No elaboration of physical or moral accomplishment can atone for the sin of parasitism.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Accompanied by a campaign against the Past; by the closing of museums, the blowing up of historical monuments (luckily most of them had already been destroyed during the Nine Years&rsquo; War); by the suppression of all books published before A.F. 15O.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Then came the question: what did my father abstain from? The workmen abstained from meat, drink, fresh air, good clothes, decent lodging, holidays, money, the society of their families, and pretty nearly everything that makes life worth living, which was perhaps the reason why they usually died twenty years or so sooner than people in our circumstances. Yet no one rewarded them for their abstinence. The reward came to my father, who abstained from none of these things, but indulged in them all to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The true diagnostic of modern gentility is parasitism.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">I simply must get one like it, said Fanny.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Take care to get what you like or you will be forced to like what you get.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">There were some things called the pyramids, for example.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Where there is no ventilation fresh air is declared unwholesome.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Henrietta seemed a little troubled. She smiled faintly, and said caressingly, It was not your fault, Sidney. I don&rsquo;t blame you.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Where there is no religion hypocrisy becomes good taste.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">My old black-patent bandolier.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">And a man called Shakespeare. You&rsquo;ve never heard of him of course.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Where there is no knowledge ignorance calls itself science.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">A fool&rsquo;s brain digests philosophy into folly, science into superstition, and art into pedantry. Hence University education.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Such are the advantages of a really scientific education.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">It&rsquo;s an absolute disgrace&ndash;that bandolier of mine.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The most popular method of distributing wealth is the method of the roulette table.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The roulette table pays nobody except him that keeps it. Nevertheless a passion for gaming is common, though a passion for keeping roulette tables is unknown.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The more stitches the less riches; the more stitches the less&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Besides, she urged, your mother belonged to one of the oldest families in England.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Immortal powers! he exclaimed, sitting bolt upright and appealing to the skies, here is a woman who believes that the only concern all this causes me is whether she thinks any the worse of me personally on account of it!</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The introduction of Our Ford&rsquo;s first T-Model&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Those who admire modern civilization usually identify it with the steam engine and the electric telegraph.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Quite so, he returned, in a polite frenzy. Nobody sees any harm in it. That is precisely the mischief of it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">I&rsquo;ve had it nearly three months.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Chosen as the opening date of the new era.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Oh, Sidney, you are determined not to be pleased. Artists don&rsquo;t keep factories.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Those who understand the steam engine and the electric telegraph spend their lives in trying to replace them with something better.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Ending is better than mending; ending is better&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">There was a thing, as I&rsquo;ve said before, called Christianity.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The conversion of a savage to Christianity is the conversion of Christianity to savagery.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">I don&rsquo;t know what became of the peasants; HE didn&rsquo;t know, and, I presume, didn&rsquo;t care. I suppose the old ones went into the workhouse, and the young ones crowded the towns, and worked for men like my father in factories. Their places were taken by cattle, which paid for their food so well that my grandfather, getting my father to take shares in the enterprise, hired laborers to cut that canal for him.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">We are told that when Jehovah created the world he saw that it was good. What would he say now?</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Ending is better than mending.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">I remember my grandfather well. He was a well-bred man, and a perfect gentleman in his manners; but, on the whole, I think he was wickeder than my father, who, after all, was caught in the wheels of a vicious system, and had either to spoil others or be spoiled by them. But my grandfather&ndash;the old rascal!&ndash;was in no such dilemma. Master as he was of his bit of merry England, no man could have enslaved him, and he might at least have lived and let live. Howbeit, there they were, the types after which we all strive.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Not all, Sidney. Not we two. I hate tradespeople and country squires. We belong to the artistic and cultured classes, and we can keep aloof from shopkeepers.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The ethics and philosophy of under-consumption&ndash;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I love new clothes, I love new clothes, I love&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">No, my dear, this is the way of those people who insist that when they are in heaven they shall be spared the recollection of such a place as hell, but are quite content that it shall exist outside their consciousness. I respect my father more&ndash;I mean I despise him less&ndash;for doing his own sweating and filching than I do the sensitive sluggards and cowards who lent him their money to sweat and filch with, and asked no questions provided the interest was paid punctually. And as to your friends the artists, they are the worst of all.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Essential when there was under-production; but in an age of machines and the fixation of nitrogen, positively a crime against society.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">When a man wants to murder a tiger he calls it sport: when the tiger wants to murder him he calls it ferocity. The distinction between Crime and Justice is no greater.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">No; but the factory is only a part of the machinery of the system. Its basis is the tyranny of brain force, which, among civilized men, is allowed to do what muscular force does among schoolboys and savages.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Man is the only animal which esteems itself rich in proportion to the number and voracity of its parasites.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">All crosses had their tops cut and became T&rsquo;s. There was also a thing called God.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Do not give your children moral and religious instruction unless you are quite sure they will not take it too seriously.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Henry Foster gave it me.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">No, my beloved, I must keep my foot on their necks for your sake as well as for my own. I am consumed with remorse for having bored my darling. You want to know why I am living here like a hermit in a vulgar two-roomed hovel instead of tasting the delights of London society with my beautiful and devoted young wife.</p>

<p class="Table">Honestly, put in the anxious-looking little girl, I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt him or anything. Honestly.</p>

<p class="Table">Of course you didn&rsquo;t, dear, said the nurse reassuringly. And so, she went on, turning back to the Director, I&rsquo;m taking him in to see the Assistant Superintendent of Psychology. Just to see if anything&rsquo;s at all abnormal.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">He talks of the higher quality of his work, as if the higher quality of it were of his own making&ndash;as if it gave him a right to work less for his neighbor than his neighbor works for him&ndash;as if the ploughman could not do better without him than he without the ploughman&ndash;as if the value of the most celebrated pictures has not been questioned more than that of any straight furrow in the arable world&ndash;as if it did not take an apprenticeship of as many years to train the hand and eye of a mason or blacksmith as of an artist&ndash;as if, in short, the fellow were a god, as canting brain worshippers have for years past been assuring him he is.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">When the wooden idol does not answer the peasant&rsquo;s prayer, he beats it: when the flesh and blood idol does not satisfy the civilized man, he cuts its head off.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">It&rsquo;s real morocco-surrogate.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Talking about her as though she were a bit of meat. Bernard ground his teeth. Have her here, have her there. Like mutton. Degrading her to so much mutton. She said she&rsquo;d think it over, she said she&rsquo;d give me an answer this week. Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford. He would have liked to go up to them and hit them in the face hard, again and again.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Is anything wrong? said the matron, putting away her book with the unconcerned resignation of an experienced person who foresees a storm in a teacup. Where is Sidney?</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Gone! Gone! Deserted me! I&ndash; The young lady&rsquo;s utterance failed, and she threw herself upon an ottoman, sobbing with passionate spite.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Marriage, or any other form of promiscuous amoristic monogamy, is fatal to large States because it puts its ban on the deliberate breeding of man as a political animal.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">We have the World State now. And Ford&rsquo;s Day celebrations, and Community Sings, and Solidarity Services.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">When domestic servants are treated as human beings it is not worthwhile to keep them.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">For a moment Henrietta seemed about to cry. Suddenly she exclaimed with enthusiasm: I will stay with you, Sidney. I will dress as a dairymaid, and have a little pail to carry milk in. The world is nothing to me except when you are with me.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Every fool believes what his teachers tell him, and calls his credulity science or morality as confidently as his father called it divine revelation.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Ford, how I hate them! Bernard Marx was thinking.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">There was a thing called Heaven; but all the same they used to drink enormous quantities of alcohol.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">A moderately honest man with a moderately faithful wife, moderate drinkers both, in a moderately healthy house: that is the true middle class unit.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The essential function of marriage is the continuance of the race, as stated in the Book of Common Prayer.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">My love, he said, shaking his head as she looked beseechingly at him, the truth is, that the first condition of work with me is your absence. When you are with me, I can do nothing but make love to you. You bewitch me. When I escape from you for a moment, it is only to groan remorsefully over the hours you have tempted me to waste and the energy you have futilized.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Marriage is popular because it combines the maximum of temptation with the maximum of opportunity.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Like meat, like so much meat.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Yes, I really do advise you to try her, Henry Foster was saying.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Ship aho-o-o-y!</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Stop crying, Hetty, for God&rsquo;s sake. You lacerate my very soul.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Ah-o-o-o-o-o-o-oy, master!</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">There was a thing called the soul and a thing called immortality.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Do ask Henry where he got it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Those who understand evil pardon it: those who resent it destroy it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Self-denial is not a virtue: it is only the effect of prudence on rascality.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">But they used to take morphia and cocaine.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">We should be so happy, she said. I would housekeep for you, and you could work as much as you pleased. Our life would be a long idyll.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">And what makes it worse, she thinks of herself as meat.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">She will change places with you, my dear, if you make her the offer.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Two thousand pharmacologists and bio-chemists were subsidized in A.P. 178.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Six years later it was being produced commercially. The perfect drug.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">He does look glum, said the Assistant Predestinator, pointing at Bernard Marx.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Let&rsquo;s bait him.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Euphoric, narcotic, pleasantly hallucinant.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">I believe you are mad, she said petulantly. The world is mad nowadays, and is galloping to the deuce as fast as greed can goad it. I merely stand out of the rush, not liking its destination.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Glum, Marx, glum.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The clap on the shoulder made him start, look up. It was that brute Henry Foster.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">If you won&rsquo;t live with me you had no right to marry me.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">All the advantages of Christianity and alcohol; none of their defects.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The savage bows down to idols of wood and stone: the civilized man to idols of flesh and blood.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">True. But that is neither your fault nor mine. We have found that we love each other too much&ndash;that our intercourse hinders our usefulness&ndash;and so we must part. Not for ever, my dear; only until you have cares and business of your own to fill up your life and prevent you from wasting mine.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">What you need is a gramme of soma.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Ford, I should like to kill him! But all he did was to say, No, thank you, and fend off the proffered tube of tablets.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">He who slays a king and he who dies for him are alike idolaters.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Take a holiday from reality whenever you like, and come back without so much as a headache or a mythology.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Neither consideration would have checked her in one of her ungovernable moods, but now she was in an abject one. Her moods seemed to come only when they were harmful to her.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Take it, insisted Henry Foster, take it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Oh, don&rsquo;t talk any more of these things, she said crossly; I cannot help them. I have my own troubles to think of.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Stability was practically assured.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">One cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy sentiments, said the Assistant Predestinator citing a piece of homely hypnopedic wisdom.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Never resist temptation: prove all things: hold fast that which is good.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">She then saw that her last opportunity of appealing to him had gone by, and she nearly burst into tears at the thought. It occurred to her that she might prevail upon him by making a scene in public. But the street was a busy one, and she was a little afraid of him.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">It only remained to conquer old age.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">She turned away and sat down on a pile of bricks, only writhing angrily when he pressed her for a word. As they neared the end of her voyage, and her intense protest against desertion remained, as she thought, only half expressed, her sense of injury grew almost unbearable.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Damn you, damn you! shouted Bernard Marx.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Hoity-toity.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">She had no answer ready. After a pause he began to speak poetically of the scenery and to offer her loverlike speeches and compliments. But she felt that he intended to get rid of her, and he knew that it was useless to try to hide that design from her.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Gonadal hormones, transfusion of young blood, magnesium salts&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">In an ugly and unhappy world the richest man can purchase nothing but ugliness and unhappiness.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">And do remember that a gramme is better than a damn.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Vice is waste of life. Poverty, obedience, and celibacy are the canonical vices.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">They went out, laughing.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">All the physiological stigmata of old age have been abolished. And along with them, of course&ndash;</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Happiness and Beauty are by-products.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Virtue consists, not in abstaining from vice, but in not desiring it.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Don&rsquo;t forget to ask him about that Malthusian belt, said Fanny.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">Characters remain constant throughout a whole lifetime.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">When a man teaches something he does not know to somebody else who has no aptitude for it, and gives him a certificate of proficiency, the latter has completed the education of a gentleman.</p>

<h2>Vonnegut Gets All Up in Dostoevski's Karass</h2>
<p>A Mashup In Honor of their Shared Birthdays<br/><br/>Listen:<br/><br/>When I was a younger man&ndash;two wives ago, 250,000 cigarettes ago, 3,000 quarts of booze ago&hellip;<br/><br/>When I was a much younger man, I began to collect material for a book to be called The Day the World Ended.<br/><br/>The book was to be factual.<br/><br/>“It’s a stupid story and can be told in two words,” began the general complacently. <br/><br/>“Two years ago—yes, nearly two, just after the opening of the new railway—I was already in civilian dress then and busy about an affair of great importance in connection with my giving up the service. I took a first-class ticket, went in, sat down, and began to smoke. Or rather I went on smoking, for I had lighted my cigar before. I was alone in the compartment. Smoking is not prohibited, nor was it allowed; it was sort of half allowed, as it usually is. Of course it depends on the person. The window was down.<br/><br/>Bokonon tells us, &ldquo;Man created the checkerboard; God created the karass.&rdquo; By that he means that a karass ignores national, institutional, occupational, familial, and class boundaries. It is as free-form as an amoeba.<br/><br/>In his &ldquo;Fifty-third Calypso,&rdquo; Bokonon invites us to sing along with him:<br/><br/>Oh, a sleeping drunkard<br/>Up in Central Park,<br/>And a lion-hunter<br/>In the jungle dark,<br/>And a Chinese dentist,<br/>And a British queen&ndash;<br/>All fit together<br/>In the same machine.<br/>Nice, nice very nice&ndash;<br/>So many different people<br/>In the same device.<br/><br/>Just before the whistle sounded, two ladies with a lapdog seated themselves just opposite me. They were late. One of them was dressed in gorgeous style in light blue; the other more soberly in black silk with a cape. They were nice-looking, had a disdainful air, and talked in English. I took no notice, of course, and went on smoking. I did hesitate, but I went on smoking close to the window, for the window was open.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, I intend in this book to include as many members of my karass as possible, and I mean to examine all strong hints as to what on Earth we, collectively, have been up to.<br/><br/>The lapdog was lying on the pale blue lady’s knee. It was a tiny creature no bigger than my fist, black with white paws, quite a curiosity. It had a silver collar with a motto on it. I did nothing. But I noticed the ladies seemed annoyed, at my cigar, no doubt. One of them stared at me through her tortoise-shell lorgnette. I did nothing again, for they said nothing. If they’d said anything, warned me, asked me—there is such a thing as language after all! But they were silent.<br/><br/>I do not intend that this book be a tract on behalf of Bokononism. I should like to offer a Bokononist warning about it, however. The first sentence in The Books of Bokonon is this:<br/><br/>&ldquo;All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Suddenly, without the slightest preface—I assure you without the slightest, as though she had suddenly taken leave of her sense—the pale blue one snatched the cigar out of my hand and flung it out of the window. The train was racing along.</p>
<p>I gazed at her aghast.<br/><br/>So I wrote this letter to Newt:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Hoenikker:<br/><br/>&quot;Or should I say, Dear Brother Hoenikker?<br/><br/>&quot;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about style and form. Leave all that to me. Just give me the bare bones of your story.<br/><br/>&quot;I will, of course, submit the final version to you for your approval prior to publication.<br/><br/>&quot;Fraternally yours&ndash;&rdquo;<br/><br/>A savage woman, yes, positively a woman of quite a savage type; yet a plump, comfortable-looking, tall, fair woman, with rosy cheeks (too rosy, in fact). <br/><br/>&ldquo;I am sorry to say that I don&rsquo;t know as much about your illustrious family as I should, and so don&rsquo;t know whether you have brothers and sisters. If you do have brothers and sisters, I should like very much to have their addresses so that I can send similar requests to them.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Her eyes glared at me. Without uttering a word and with extraordinary courtesy, the most perfect, the most refined courtesy, I delicately picked up the lapdog by the collar in two fingers and flung it out of the window after the cigar! It uttered one squeal. The train was still racing on.<br/><br/>Dr. Hoenikker himself was no doubt a member of my karass, though he was dead before my sinookas, the tendrils of my life, began to tangle with those of his children.<br/><br/>“You are a monster!” exclaimed Nastasya Filippovna, laughing and clapping her hands like a child.<br/><br/>To which Newt replied:<br/><br/>&ldquo;I am sorry to be so long about answering your letter. That sounds like a very interesting book you are doing. Nobody knows where my brother Frank is. He disappeared right after Father&rsquo;s funeral two years ago, and nobody has heard from him since. For all we know, he may be dead now.&rdquo;<br/><br/>“Bravo, bravo!” cried Ferdyshtchenko.<br/><br/>Pititsyn too smiled, though he had also been extremely put out by the general’s entrance. Even Kolya laughed and cried “Bravo!” too.<br/><br/>&ldquo;I remember I was playing on the living-room carpet outside my father&rsquo;s study door in Ilium, New York. The door was open, and I could see my father. He was wearing pajamas and a bathrobe. He was smoking a cigar. He was playing with a loop of string. Father was staying home from the laboratory in his pajamas all day that day. He stayed home whenever he wanted to.&rdquo;<br/><br/>“And I was right, perfectly right,” the triumphant general continued warmly. ”For if cigars are forbidden in a railway carriage, dogs are even more so.”<br/><br/><br/></p>

<p><strong>Cthonic Chronos</strong></p>
<p>The Greeks had a very Lovecraftian view of time, as personified by Chronos. A monstrous inevitability, time has not only eaten the past, but will eat the future, and everything it ate was in some sense its descendant. Hungry and ineffable, this personification of entropy is much more frightening than Maxwell&rsquo;s Demon (who personified negentropy).</p>
<p>Remember: one day, unexpectedly, time will eat you. It cannot be predicted or avoided, so try to live your life so that when the final boss of the universe defeats you, your last thoughts are &ldquo;fuck yeah, that was worthwhile&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>The koan of the derivative work</h2>
<p>Wen the Monk entered the cell of his friend, Tu-Tzi Fru-Tzi to find the floor uncharacteristically full of crumpled papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tu-Tzi, what are you doing?&rdquo; Wen asked. &ldquo;Some kind of origami floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu-Tzi looked upon his hands in despair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to write something, but everything I do is derivative&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to avoid derivative work?&rdquo; Wen asked. &ldquo;How original!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few hours of watching cat videos, Tu-Tzi was enlightened.</p>

<h2>A Meditation on Slacktivism</h2>
<p>Bung Fu entered the mojo dojo, where Nopants was practicing his google-katas.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Brother Nopants,&rdquo; said Bung Fu, &ldquo;Social Media is tiresome. Everybody&rsquo;s standing on soapboxbook, tweeting about causes, everybody&rsquo;s signing petitions, everybody&rsquo;s reaching towards unity &hellip; while sitting still. Some people call it &lsquo;slacktivism&rsquo; - a way of making yourself feel like you&rsquo;re helping without actually doing anything. Is it wasted energy?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Nopants cleared his cache and said, &ldquo;You are correct in this, Bung Fu - the individual has little power over the group. To change a group, you must act on a group scale.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Bung Fu smiled, &ldquo;So posting about politics and social justice is just an ego game, it makes the individual feel good but doesn&rsquo;t help the group?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Brother Nopants shook his head and spoke slowly, &ldquo;The group and the individual are the same. The group reaches for unity through its members. The individual posts are powerless, but as a group&hellip;&rdquo;<br/><br/>Bung Fu sat in silence for some time. <br/><br/><br/><br/>&ldquo;Is the individual really so powerless?&rdquo; asked Bung Fu.<br/><br/>Nopants shook his head again, &ldquo;Some are, because many groups are not positioned to affect each other. But as I said, the individual and the group are the same. Even your individual question carries a group&rsquo;s energy.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Which group?&rdquo; asked Bung Fu.<br/><br/>&ldquo;As an individual&rdquo; replied the monk, &ldquo;you have the power to choose.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2011/08/putting-rock-occult-connection-into.html">Putting the Rock-Occult Connection into Context</a></h2>
<p><span>I have mentioned before in passing the connection documented between popular music and occult practice. I have come to the tentative conclusion that this is a subset of the general connection between occult movements and economic elites, and how this relates to leisure-class societies. </span><br/><br/><span>Most of us spend a large portion of our time working. It is anomalous to have large quantities of leisure time prior to old age, but there has been a leisure class since at least the establishment of Eridug more than six thousand years ago. The leisure class is defined not by not working, but instead by not needing to work (and thus having their occupation driven by interest rather than economic factors). My thesis about leisure class occupation is that there are three primary categories of popular leisure-class occupation, one of which is dominated by mysticism. </span><br/><br/><span>Those classes of occupation available only or mostly to those who are not viscerally and mortally concerned with the accumulation of money are: physical philosophy, abstract philosophy, and time-wasting. Physical philosophy contains such things as tinkering, home improvement, small-scale engineering, painting, sculpting, scientific experimentation, electronics, model trains, and computer programming &ndash; things that are ostensibly potentially profitable but whose potential for profit is a gamble. Abstract philosophy has potentially higher stakes and a lower success rate, and contains both those things we think of as philosophy today, mysticism, the occult, and more rigorous practices like mathematics. Time-wasting contains things like casual golfing &ndash; things that are done to fill leisure time but not done in such a way that money could be gained from them. </span><br/><br/><span>A rock star is not initiated into the occult by some record-company-sponsored ritual. A rock star, when he or she makes it big, no longer has to work day and night to make it big; there is more leisure time (though I am not implying that rock stars are slackers; a self-made band, as opposed to a group manufactured by a record company, must generate enormous quantities of flukes before managing to get signed &ndash; Radiohead sent out demos for years under the name On A Friday before they managed to push out Pablo Honey &ndash; and an established artist can have those flukes published rather than sending demos to yet another company). If you no longer have money woes and you can get away with putting in a third of the work you have for years, you can either maintain your current effort (and potentially burn out) or you can take up those things that you could not before. As a result, The Beatles made Crowley and Hare Krishna references, and Bowie writes songs about the Sephiroth. It is easier to get into the occult in a group already saturated with occultists and ex-occultists, and the popular music scene is such a group. But, other notable successful musical artists have taken up building instruments or painting or piloting commercial aircraft. </span></p>
