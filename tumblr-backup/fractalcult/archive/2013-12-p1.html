<h2>~ Exploring beyond Maps ~ Part I</h2>
<p>A more <span>skeptical</span> leaning with regard to model realism has long been part of Discordian Mythos, and indeed we all hear the old anecdote about <em>Maps</em> and <em>Territories</em> gets thrown around a lot (as it should be). Robert Anton Wilson – who called himself an Agnostic Mystic – probably did a great deal to promote this perspective, for example in this famous segment from Prometheus Rising:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All experience is a muddle, until we make a model to explain it. The model can clarify the muddles, but the model is never the muddle itself. “The map is not the territory”; the menu does not taste like the meal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implicitly, the metaphor of a Map elicits the idea of <em>correspondence</em>; <strong>the symbols on the Map are intended to correspond to objects in the Territory.</strong> This fits in with the correspondence theory of truth; a <em>descriptive</em> conception of models as representations of reality. Indeed – even <em>explanatory</em> value can be conceived as a type of causal description. I would guess the majority of scientific work is orientated around this Map conception.</p>
<p>This is all good and well, and this idea of the Map (the descriptive model) is very powerful and useful for navigating and clarifying the Territory.<strong> However I would doubt a person&rsquo;s exploration skills if they spend more time staring at a Map than at the Territory.</strong> Nor do we as inhabitants of the Territory spend all our time navigating - we live here, work here, and play here - we use more Tools than just Maps.</p>
<p>What if some ideas are more like a <em>Compass</em> – for example the contrast between Erisian and Anerisian – are there for giving a rough orientation in the Territory? Or perhaps others still function as a<em> Torch</em>, illuminating (inner or outer) darkness in the territory (think of how the law of fives helps reveal our confirmation bias). Other might be <em>MetaTools</em> – such as the<em> Analytical Knife</em> that dissects Maps, or the <em>Synthetic Duck Tape</em> for binding them together. The list goes on&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The treatment of ideas as Tools is nothing new; in the American Pragmatic tradition a position known as<em> Instrumentalism</em> sought to treat scientific theory as a tool for prediction, and our kindred<em> Chaos Magic</em> tradition takes a similar attitude to beliefs. In my opinion this is a powerful way to treat thoughts and models, although certainly not the only valid way. However – if we are to take this attitude –<strong> I would suggest we explore beyond Maps.</strong></p>

<h2>~On Projection and the Corrective Hyperbole in Discourse~</h2>
<p>On occasion I catch myself in discourse projecting a misconception on the other person based on very little information. Most frequently I seem to do this with misconceptions which repeatedly revealed themselves in conversations I have had - whether I made them or another. Ironically I seem most frustrated when a person is repeating an error I have frequently made in the past. I suspect I am not the only one.<br/><br/>There are topics of exceeding subtlety which demand frequent course corrections; the balance between the Anerisian and Erisian; between Rationalism and Skepticism, between Dualistic Distinction and Non-Dualistic Intuition, between Realism and Surrealism or between Humor and Seriousness. In such fine and nuanced lines, I have found myself - in seeming hypocrisy - pushing in one direction or the other depending on the context.<br/><br/>Hyperbole is the the direction opposite of the bias is a frequent teaching tool in Asian religious traditions; so the Buddha emphasized suffering in the world only to correct the imbalanced view that it is all about pleasure; so the Daoists emphasize ineffability,  unknowability and inaction only to correct for the over emphasis of the converse by other schools. <br/><br/>Principia Discordia seems to have taken up this tool, indeed the very spirit of it almost based on it, and so brilliantly created a movement to help correct an imbalance in Western thinking. Many have oft pointed out that many Spags take this too far, and correctly respond by pushing the other way. This kind of situation can and does explode into the verbal equivalent of a WWF wrestling match. We might do well to consider we are sometimes project exaggeration or misconception on others, and perhaps try and nuance the hyperbole to the circumstances&hellip;..<br/><br/>&hellip;.especially when we talk with Discordians.</p>

<h2>1. HUNG MUNG </h2>
<p>-&gt;&lt;-</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Sage of Ancient China and Official Discordian Missionary to the Heathen Chinese. He who originally devised THE SACRED CHAO. Patron of the Season of Chaos. Holyday: Jan 5.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>  -Principia Discordia</em></p>
<p><em>-&gt;&lt;-</em></p>
<p>In Chuang Tzu there appears in the 11th chapter appears a character called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Meng" title="Hung-Meng">Hung Meng</a> . Wikipedia notes it<em> &ldquo;compounds hong </em><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%B4%BB" title="wikt:鴻">鴻</a><em> &quot;wild goose, swan; vast, great&rdquo; and meng </em><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%92%99" title="wikt:蒙">蒙</a><em> &ldquo;covered; ignorant (esp. in childhood), untutored; encounter, receive; (<a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yijing" title="Yijing">Yijing</a>) <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_hexagram_04#Hexagram_4" title="I Ching hexagram 04">Hexagram 4</a>&rdquo;.

<p>The Sam Hamil and Jerome P. Seaton translation of selected chapters - the Essential Chuang Tzu - does an excellent job at relaying the absurdity of this tale:</p>
<p>-&gt;&lt;-</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-689fa9cf-0838-2dfc-5e43-32d00cfdb177"><span>CLOUD GENERAL WANDERED EASTERLY. EMERGING FROM under the Fu-yao tree&rsquo;s branches, he bumped into Big Goose Dummy. Drumming on his tummy, Big Goose Dummy was about to take off like a hopping sparrow. When Cloud General saw him, he hesitated, then stopped, amazed. &quot;Say, Old One,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;who are you and what are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Big Goose Dummy kept drumming on his tummy, flapping and hopping like a sparrow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rambling.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I have something to ask about,&rdquo; Cloud General said.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The ch'i of heaven is out of harmony,&rdquo; Cloud General said, &ldquo;and the ch'i of earth is gnarly and knotted. The Six Ch'i are out of tune, the Four Seasons out of order. Now I want to harmonize the essence of the Six Ch'i for the benefit of all living things. How am I to undertake such a task?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Still drumming his tummy and scratching his head and sparrow-hopping about, Big Goose Dummy muttered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>So Cloud General didn&rsquo;t get his answer.</span></p>
<p><span>Three years later, however, when he was wandering east in the wilds where people are even dumber than in Sung, he ran into Big Goose Dummy again. Cloud General was happy, and ran up, shouting, &ldquo;Oh, Heaven! Have you forgotten me?&rdquo; He bowed his head to the ground and begged for another audience.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I wander and ramble without knowing what I seek,&rdquo; Big Goose Dummy said. &ldquo;A madman, a king dog, I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going. The wanderer, unhaltered, is not deceived by what is seen. What more do you want?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite a mad-dog king myself,&rdquo; Cloud General said. &ldquo;But the people all follow my trail. I can&rsquo;t get what I want for them, and it is for their sake that I now beg you to speak a single word.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;What throws the warp of heaven into chaos, what rebels against the facts of things?&rdquo; Big Goose Dummy replied. &ldquo;What can keep mysterious heaven from accomplishing its ends? What scatters herds of beasts, makes birds cry in the night, and brings bad luck to bugs? I have the idea that it&rsquo;s excess ruling hu-mankind!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;What can I do about that?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Big Goose Dummy said, &ldquo;I have an idea: poison. Or take off and fly home.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Meeting with you,&rdquo; Cloud General said, &ldquo;is difficult. Let me hear just one word.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;My idea?&rdquo; Big Goose Dummy said. &ldquo;Nourish your heart and mind. Stay put and do nothing. Things will change on their own. 1 )rop your form and your body. Drop seeing and hearing. Forget connections. Forget things. Find the Great Unity in the watery vastness. Cut loose from heart and mind. Let go of the spirit. Go forth soulless as a desert. The ten thousand things all return to their roots. They return to their roots without knowing. Get into the pure mud of the Muddle Puddle. Run out your string right there. Never leave. If you&rsquo;re knowing it, you&rsquo;re leaving it. Without asking its name or taking a peek at the facts, things have come down solid from ancient times, all on their own.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Heaven has handed down to me the Power of Virtue,&rdquo; Cloud General said, &ldquo;and shown me in dark silence the black dog of mystery. All my life, I&rsquo;ve bent and bowed my body in the hunt for it. Now I&rsquo;ve captured it.&rdquo; He bowed once more, politely took his leave, and departed.</span></p>
