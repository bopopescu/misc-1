<h2>Discordian Easter Ritual</h2>
<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://cramul.us/post/80879782450/discordian-easter-ritual">cramulus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Discordian was invited by some local pagans to lead an “Erisian” ritual for Eostre. I’m not sure they knew what they were getting into. If you wanted a serious ritual, you shouldn’t ask a Discordian. So the guy wants to turn it into a mindfuck. Here was my advice:<br/><br/> “I just want to remind you we’ve got a perfectly good Erisian Easter tradition - the Erister Egg Hunt. Hide a bunch of crazy crap in plastic eggs - th<span class="text_exposed_show">e kind of stuff which you would not expect to find in a plastic egg (whatever that is)- and then let people discover them.<br/><br/> I think a good erisian ritual does the opposite of what these pagans might want. It unravels the tapestry. It intensifies the hollowness and meaninglessness of ritual. A good discordian ritual holds up a mirror, makes people question whether they ever want to do this stuff again.<br/><br/> I’d be tempted to just do something silly which only technically fits the ritual form. These pagans, they’ve got this fairly rigid sense of what a ritual is, what it’s for, and some of them probably consider themselves “experts”. Your job is to show them how meaningless it is, how they are playing childish games in the lap of Death. And that’s why I wouldn’t just do a ha ha silly ritual.<br/><br/> If I were you, I’d want to really shake these people up. Establish control of their bodies using Call &amp; Response and Simon-Says type techniques. Then lead the group out into traffic and have everybody lay down in the road (you first!). The cars will be honking and it will feel dangerous. If possible, get a friend to SPEED up to the group and then slam on the breaks, screeeech.<br/><br/> As everybody flinches, as the discomfort and fear rises to the point that they physically resist your ‘ritual’ and walk away from it, you can tell them they have come through the eye of the needle. They have died and been reborn. They have taken control back from you. The Self which was willing to lay down in traffic because an “expert” or “priest” commanded it IS DEAD NOW. The robot is slain and the new self IS RISEN.<br/><br/> THAT’S a fucking Easter ritual.”</span></p>

<h2>You are probably being lied to</h2>
<p>The question is not &ldquo;Is someone lying to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone is probably lying to you. A lot of people are probably lying to you. Heard an advertisement? There are probably lies, either explicit or implicit. The gadget advertised with yellow, sans-serif Arial Black on dead digital blue might not work at all. The beauty cream will not make you more sexually desirable.</p>
<p>So the question is not &ldquo;Is someone lying to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The questions you need to ask are &ldquo;What am I being told? Why is it being told to me? What does the speaker hope to achieve by telling me this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Check the facts when you can. Understanding the facts helps you understand the reasons behind the lies, and behind the truths too. Understanding the reasons behind the lies you are told allows you to apply another grid to the chaotic reality you perceive, revealing to you new relationships between your data points.</p>
<p>Some lies are more useful than others. Some pointless lies can be enlightening, if you&rsquo;re clever.</p>
<p>In short, bullshit helps the flowers grow, and that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
