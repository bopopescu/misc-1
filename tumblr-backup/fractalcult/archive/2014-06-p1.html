<h2><a href="http://cramul.us/post/90316046652/discordian-meditation">A Discordian Meditation</a></h2>
<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://cramul.us/post/90316046652/discordian-meditation">cramulus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meditation is, in part, about leaving your body, leaving the ego, leaving the self, until there’s no you left</p>
<p>To this end, a mantra can be helpful. It doesn’t matter what the mantra consists of. It’s just something for your mind to wrap itself around and spin over and over again until you get lost in it.</p>
<p>OM MANI PADME HUM. Om mani padme hum. OM MANI PADME HUM. Om mani padme hum.</p>
<p>It doesn’t even mean anything! It’s just Holy nonsense. (Fnord) Just say it in a rhythm, over and over again, until you forget about your body. There is no body, there is no you, all that exists is just the sound.</p>
<p>This is how Eris taught me to meditate:</p>
<p>at some point, let your mantra dissolve into this:</p>
<p>OU-WA TAGU SIAM</p>
<p>over and over again</p>
<p>OU-WA TAGU SIAM<br/>OU-WA TAGU SIAM<br/>OU-WA TAGU SIAM</p>
<p>It’s impossible to stop yourself from recognizing what you’re saying. But that’s the goal, to say it until it isn’t made of words anymore.</p>
<p>As you say any word over and over again, your brain stops processing it as language, it loses all meaning, it just becomes sound.</p>
<p>And then there’s the self-awareness that keeps floating back in, that you’re saying this very silly self deprecating phrase, but you’ve gotta ignore that, it’s just sound, it’s just words, there’s no You to feel silly.</p>
<p>If you can meditate on this mantra until it loses all meaning, until its not funny anymore, you will have destroyed the line between holy man and actual goose.</p>

<div class="fwn fcg"><span>On the Discordian Society 2014 FB group, </span>Aimée Wright asked the following:</div>

<p>&ldquo;Who would win!? Eris vs. Baphomet! Hedge your bets!&rdquo;</p>

As a Chaoist as well as a Discordian I tend to place Eris as part of the Chao.</span><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$1:0"/><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$3:0"/><span data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$4:0">But maybe Eris the same thing as the Chao? Principia says she is a goddess of Chaos (as well as Confusion and Discord), and yet the Erisian is only one side of the Chao (which has uncountably many sides of course). One solution to this paradox is to say both are right, and the Chao contains itself; but then the Anerisian would be non-Chao (the Fnord?) which also seems odd. Thus the Chao would be a symbol for the Non-Duality of Duality and Non-Duality, with the Erisian representing Chaoward&rsquo;s and the Anerisian representing Fnordwards manifestations of the Chao. Maybe couldbe possible sensible Sri Syadasti.</span><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$5:0"/><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$7:0"/><span data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$8:0">But <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/whoisbaphomet/" target="_blank">who the Fnord is Baphomet</a>? It seems this is a lost and ancient mystery upon which many speculations have been speckled. It has been attributed as anything from a code representing the Temple of Solomon to the Templars, to Sophia the goddess of Wisdom (Eris?), to the Father of Understanding (Aneris?), to the Unity of All Opposites and Pan the Pangenitor (the Chao?). Perhaps Baphomet is Puck trickster god (from whence the diminutive form Pixie derives). Note that these last, goatlike representation seems to be recent (19th c.). I honestly can&rsquo;t I guess today I will choose to treat Baphomet as Aneris or the Fnord side of the Chao Coin. This master of Illusion so bamboozled various mystics as to gain so many different attributions, it seems appropriate.</span><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$9:0"/><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$11:0"/><span data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$12:0">So in the context of this current, arbitrary and moral mythological arrangement, I would answer neither and both. They tend to fuck one day as eternal lovers, and battle the next as arch enemies. Neither would exist without the other!</span><span data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$0:0"></span></span></span></p>

<p>Add the year of your own Discordian Illumination (i.e. the year when you found out you’re a Discordian). Just put your Holy Name, country and year of illumination in the comments, and in the end, (maybe? probably? hopefully?) <a href="http://aktion23.userboard.org/" title="Aktion 23">we</a> will piece it all together into the graphics.

<h2>Gnostic Discordianism (early draft, feedback welcome)</h2>
<p>We live in a material universe. Everything we think, say, do, experience, is a product of a physical process that can be known and understood. &ldquo;Life&rdquo; is a relationship between different forms of information. ((in this way, religions, businesses, groups of friends, ideologies, are all very much living beings much like individuals))<br/><br/>A long time ago, in the primordial sea, matter happened to collide in a way which initiated a &ldquo;self perpetuating&rdquo; physical process. Primeval DNA. Over the course of millions of years, this process has perpetuating its survival through reproduction and mutation. The well adapted forms survived, producing more mutant offspring. <br/><br/>In this way, the primordial entity, that first strand of DNA, is present in all of us. It has developed sensory and cognitive apparatus so it can better understand the world. It is still trying to figure out the universe. Each expression of this common spirit believes itself to be distinct, an individual, perhaps an ego. It accomplishes the macrocosmic goals by pursuing microcosmic needs. Things like writing and architecture are advanced DNA, they are ways of passing information and relationships from one generation to the next. Our drive to survive, to reproduce, to create something lasting, is an expression of the overmind, the common spirit which unites all of us.<br/><br/>The individual expression of the common spirit is called the soul. Souls are part of the common spirit in the same way that cells are part of the body. They are all united, acting towards the same end, even if they perceive themselves to be distinct.<br/><br/>The body is just meat. Unknowing. A machine. A vessel. A collection of cells and tissue.<br/><br/>The soul (or mind) pilots the body, generally unaware of the spirit sleeping in all of us. A collection of ideas and beliefs. The soul (or mind) and the ego (or self) are one and the same.<br/><br/>The spirit (or overmind) pilots the soul, guiding it towards the light, out of illusion and into truth.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The material world is blind and unknowing, an idiot god that we live inside.      <br/><br/>The idea of survival through disruption and mutation, through creativity, through a transcendence of the mortal world, is called Eris. She is the substance from which our scientists and musicians weave patterns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The soul forgets about the spirit. The soul thinks it is all there is. This is the ego trap. <br/><br/>The material world is full of pleasures that the soul wants. Pleasure keeps us in our egos, in our bodies, in our tiny little microscopic ideas of what life is. The whole heaven myth that the Abrahamic religions lay out is a trap - it tells us that if we attend the soul, the soul will be rewarded. It tells us that there is an evil shadow in the universe which we must defeat, without telling us the shadow is just the part of the spirit which is furthest away from the source. The material world is real, but it is a distraction.<br/><br/>Beyond pleasure there is ecstacy. Ecstacy is the soul&rsquo;s experience of the spirit. This is the true source, true pleasure, death of ego, transcendence of self and other. Material pleasures are just trying to simulate ecstacy, they&rsquo;re a bad copy of it. Some of them have paths to ecstacy, but those paths are tricky, frought with other traps and distractions that will keep the soul anchored in the material world.<br/><br/><strong>ahhh wait I have to stop telling you the truth, I&rsquo;m at work. Fuck it, gotta go make the benjamins. Back into the distraction. More iterations on this concept later</strong></p>
