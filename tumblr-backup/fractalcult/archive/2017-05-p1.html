We thought 5/23 might be the right day to make this public, even though it isn’t 100% ready yet…<br/></p>

<p><b>About the D.I.S.L.I.B.


</b></p>
<p>
The <b>D.I.S.L.I.B.</b> is the <b>D</b>iscordian <b>I</b>nternet <b>S</b>ociety’s <b>L</b>ibrary of <b>I</b>nteresting <b>B</b>ooks. Or maybe “DISLIB” is just short for <b>Dis</b>cordian <b>Lib</b>rary. Who knows?
</p>
<p>
It is a collection of all kinds of stuff, may they be discordian, 
discordian-related or just interesting for chaotic scholars and 
followers of other silly cults. We hope that all the collected stuff we 
are offering is free. In case it isn’t, and especially if it is your 
un-free stuff we are offering *<i>gulp</i>* illegaly here, just tell us (<i>as soon as the corresponding forms are ready</i>), and we take it down.
</p>
<p>
As you might have guessed from the logo - a winged St. Gulik that has 
been shamelessly adapted to a pseudo-retro-egyptian style - we have been
 inspired by the ancient Library of Alexandria. Also, by the <a href="http://bibanon.org/" title="http://bibanon.org/">Bibliotheca Anonoma</a> project, the Discordian Archives and the <a href="http://nmrk2359.wixsite.com/dolmmm" title="http://nmrk2359.wixsite.com/dolmmm">Discordian Online Library of the​ M’.’M’.’M’.’</a>​​​, which also provided the base for our current stock.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of “we” all the time, you might wonder who we are. Maybe you 
don’t. We tell you anyway. Currently, there’s two of us: Abbot Ron 
Oxymo, head of the Ordo Dea Discordia and His Quasaric Sphericity the 
Bwana Honolulu, head of Zimmer523, the German Discordian AnArchive. But 
we are open for applications.
</p>
<p>
Also, submissions. Are you missing some important work? Maybe your own? Give us a hint (<i>again, as soon as the corresponding forms are ready</i>). <br/></p>

<p>Submissions, criticism and applications are also accepted via tumblr messages. ;-) <br/></p>
