<h2>Epochial 500th Post: Announcing FractalCult.Net</h2>
<p>Dear Fractilian Denizens,</p>
<p>The Fractal Cult tumblog has been around for a while now; in fact, this is its 500th post! Since its inception, the Fractal Cult has traversed scales from micro to meso to macro, slid between dimensions, explored issues spanning the spectrum of human existence from (a)philosophical, to (ir)religious, to (a)social and (a)political to (un)scientific and (a)technological.<br/><br/>I wanted to have our dear founding father <a href="http://cramul.us">Cramulus</a> make this post, but he is immensely busy these days, so I will be doing it in his stead. On his behalf - and mine - I would like to thank you all for making this awesome place happen - with all its wealth of diversity, ideas and non-sense. Where else could we find such a mix?<br/><br/>Tumblr is nice and all, but I figure the time has come for the Fractal Cult to expand, to zoom out into new spaces and dimensions. To this end, I have decided to set up a wordpress website for the Fractal Cult, hosted on my server. I hope this medium will permit longer essays and stories, and encourage a new level of discourse. <br/><br/>At the moment, there is almost nothing there but a crude design; <strike>we will probably be importing all the tumblr content soon</strike> [<em>Update: we have imported all the tumblr content to our new site!</em>]. I want to invite any and all writers and readers of the Fractal Cult to participate in this expansion. If you wish to have an account as a writer there, simply email me at ehnix555@gmail.com. I am looking for reinforcements since a lot of questions remain open on how to set it up. Help me shape this new home for the Fractal Cult!<br/><br/>So check it out -  <a href="http://www.fractalcult.net">FractalCult.Net!</a> We hope for at least 500 more wonder filled posts and a diversity of people and other such creatures on board, to make this a kickass Discordian webzine!<br/><br/>Chao &amp; Fnords be with Ye,</p>
<p>Ixxie</p>
