<h2>Fun with self-deception</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re lying to yourself. We all are. But hey, fuck it, that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Alright, it&rsquo;s not life. But it&rsquo;s matter.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Do you know what a galaxy is made of? 99 point something percent of it is empty space. I mean, we live on the fraction of a percent, but still, it&rsquo;s like throwing a couple of pins into an empty ballroom.</p>
<p>But you know what&rsquo;s really similar to a galaxy? An atom.</p>
<p>Down to the amount of empty space between the stuff in the middle (protons, neutrons) and the floaty bits around the edge (electrons).</p>
<p>Now this isn&rsquo;t a science lesson, so I&rsquo;m not going to get too bogged down in the numbers. I&rsquo;m glossing over some details, but the point remains valid. And atoms are mostly nothing. Like galaxies. From here, a galaxy sure as hell looks like a whole lot of stuff, but if you get up close (like on a planet?) you see a whole lot of nothing between little bits of something.</p>
<p><span>Likewise, from the surface of a planet, stuff looks solid, but it&rsquo;s 99 point something percent nothing.</span></p>
<p>Everything big maps to smaller stuff. The known universe looks like a brain cell. A galaxy looks like an atom. And if you keep going, with that 99 point whatever percent nothing?</p>
<p>The amount of stuff that isn&rsquo;t nothing - that is actually matter - gets closer and closer to 0. And as we get more data, we start figuring out&hellip; well, we start figuring out that &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; might be something we can&rsquo;t wrap our heads around right now.</p>
<p>Because if all that nothing really is nothing, then it starts looking like matter is nothing pretending really hard that it isn&rsquo;t nothing.</p>
<p>So I think my point is that sometimes it takes a few nonsensical delusions to get you through the very real possibility that you&rsquo;re a whole lot of nothing that kept going through a lot of bullshitting. The problem, I think, is not the delusion. The problem is when you forget that the delusion is a delusion. There&rsquo;s not a pretty good chance you&rsquo;re all the delusion of some demented nothing that decided it was going to pretend to not be nothing, just to be a nonconformist. </p>
<p>So maybe we are all just delusional void pretending it&rsquo;s matter for a little while. Either way, don&rsquo;t worry so much, don&rsquo;t be a jerk, and you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>I knew a motivational speaker who said the same thing, in fewer words. She told me that you don&rsquo;t have to know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing to get what you want out of life. You just need a rough goal, a good first step, and the will to follow it through no matter what. I mean, I think it&rsquo;s implied you need to know you don&rsquo;t always know the next step. If you don&rsquo;t and you&rsquo;re pretending you do, you just get all anxious and angsty, or you get defensive and shitty - maybe both. A lot can go foul when you forget you&rsquo;re just pretending to be something nobody really is - that is to say, pretending to have your shit very together.</p>
<p>Know what I do when I get anxious and angsty? I pull out a physics book, and I start thinking about how it&rsquo;s possible - incredibly unlikely, mind, but possible - that all matter is just void trying to pretend otherwise. Sure, maybe my delusion sounds weird to you, but over a beer, that thought just makes me laugh, every time.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
