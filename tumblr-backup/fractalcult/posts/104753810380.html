<blockquote><p><small>(Translation of a German text by me on Aktion23)</small></p>
<p>Recently I noticed something, that is to say the similarity between two symbols. On the one hand the Egyptian <a class="postlink" href="http://symboldictionary.net/?p=641" rel="nofollow"><em>Ankh</em> symbol</a> , the glyph for life, eternal life or the life after death:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../media/tumblr_inline_ngbe3iOhgz1rowyz8.png"/></p>
<p>And on the other hand, the <a class="postlink" href="http://symboldictionary.net/?p=1080" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;Satanic Cross&rdquo;</a> , also known as <em>Leviathan Cross</em> (originally the alchemical symbol for black sulphur):</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../media/tumblr_inline_ngbe3iIrUR1rowyz8.png"/></p>
<p>I found the similarity in form, the combination of loop and cross shape, quite remarkable, but thinking about the Latin name almost left me speechless. &gt;_&gt; Because the Ankh is called <em>Crux Ansata</em> in Latin, which means something like “handled cross” or “cross with a handle”. And the sulphurous-satanic Leviathan Cross’ is obvious called… o_o <em>Crux Satana.</em> XD<br/><br/> OK, that sounds very similar, in the front part naturally we got “Crux” for “cross”, and behind that an adjective, and both are formed from the same letters… even almost the same syllables… from <em>A<strong>N</strong></em>-<span><ins><strong>S</strong>A</ins></span>-<strong>T</strong><span>A</span> to <span><ins><strong>S</strong>A</ins></span>-<strong>T</strong><span>A</span>-<em><strong>N</strong>A</em> isn’t a long way to go, simply turning the first syllable and returns them to the back … if you do that now again, to get to, um… &lt;_&lt; <strong> T</strong><span>A</span>-<em><strong>N</strong>A</em>-<ins><span>A</span><span><span><strong>S</strong></span></span></ins>. Hm, <em>Crux Tanaas.</em> Sounds like shit, but fun. %-D<br/><br/> How would that look like then? The Ankh has a loop and below that the longitudinal beam and crossbeam. With the Leviathan Cross, it’s a double loop, and above that again a longitudinal beam and this time two crossbars. So, the next iteration would have three loops, and below that (it’s alternating each time) a beam with three crossbars. Something like this:</p>

<p>:-D Thus, a new icon, arisen from the line of the millennia-old Ankh and the centuries-old symbol for sulphur. Now what we do with it? <br/><br/> Well, you could of course carry this further, but I think the next symbol (with four loops and four crossbeams, back to the top) is only necessary in a range of a few decades. Anyways, it’s gonna be called <em>Crux Naasat</em>. After that, a few years later, comes the five-fold <em>Crux Asatan,</em> then a few months later, the six-fold <em>Crux Atansa</em> and… o_O then we seem to end up back at the <em>Crux Ansata</em>. -_-<br/><br/> Well, whatever. ^^</p></blockquote>
