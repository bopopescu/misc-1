<p>Over time, established symbolism, classical revivalism, or other ancient reconstruction traditions seem less and less useful for describing our strange postmodern world. Science, religion, and philosophy have been racing for a good model of the world we live in. We live in a dynamic world of changes and complexity; few symbols are able to capture that.</p>
<p><br/>To that end we propose the Fractal. It is a relatively new concept, coined by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Many important &hellip; patterns of Nature are either irregular or fragmented to such an extreme degree that &hellip; classical geometry &hellip; is hardly of any help in describing their form. &hellip; I hope to show that it is possible in many cases to remedy this absence of geometric representation by using a family of shapes I propose to call fractals&hellip;&rdquo; (Mandelbrot, 1977)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/>At a glance, an image of a fractal set is very complex. One can see a general shape characterized by rough, irregular edges. If we zoom in to examine these mysterious borders, we discover new shapes within them, new truths and nuances that were hidden to us at the lower levels of magnification. And these truths, upon inspection, are similarly muddy and complex. But they are familiar to us! They carry a structural-similarity to their parent shape.</p>
<p><br/>The Fractal is one of the only symbols which does not seek to reduce complexity. Through complexity, many things are hidden from us. But the universe is ultimately knowable because it is recursive, self-descriptive, it features recurring patterns through which we can know both the large and the small.</p>
<p>This is the first teaching of the Fractal Cult.</p>
<p><strong>The universe is infinitely complex, but recursive.</strong></p>
<p>This is why thy biological systems are a pretty good description of our society. (thy circulatory system, for example, has a lot in common with both the transportation system and the economy.)</p>
<p>You, Einstein, and Jeffery Dahmer have basically the same problems.</p>
<p>This is why it makes sense to talk about organizations with the same language we use to describe individuals.</p>
<p>The trials you face in day to day life are a synecdoche of the greater spiritual trials you will face during thy life.</p>
<p><strong>This is why you can see the truth in clouds.</strong></p>
