<h2>Title Optional #1</h2>
<p>Waited forever for plane, drove in circles on narrow roads, untold frustration.  There is calmness on one side and the pounding heart of the sea at the other.  La Mare vineyard, beautifully manicured but only sold tea and scones.  Not an acceptable lunch after 12 waking hours.  Sausage and chips 2.5 miles from the devil’s hole.  Would like to see where the garden of Eden sunk into hell.  Morbid curiosity, you know the drill.  You know he drills. Lucifer’s only sin was a love of excavations.</p>

<p>The town is like the clothes of a ghost.  The near dead silence of a mute city at night is punctuated by the belligerent cries of the occasional drunk.  It’s midnight in Paris.  We pass the sleeping carcasses of shopping malls and gleaming white skeletons of family restaurants long since forgotten, now a facsimile of passion and home-comforts.  There are always the mists, tugging silently, relentlessly, at the elegant architectures of the past and the sculpted, gleaming towers of the present.  Both eroded in equal measure.  Time has no sense of history.  Time has no respect for the past.  Time has no time for you.</p>

<p>I failed as a human.  Do never forget that 7 year old girl and her mother.  Also fruit bats have a 6ft wing span.  That’s messed up.</p>

<p>The waves lapped feebly at the warm pebble beach, like a lost child clutching at a favourite toy (or a chocolate bar), occasionally mustering the strength to excite the stones into a short death rattle.  Even in hindsight those decisions seem impossible to make.</p>

<p>Strange times.</p>
