<h2>So I got in my car and drove deeper into the Universe</h2>
<p>I tried to leave the Fractal Cult compound today. I haven&rsquo;t been off the reservation in a while, I just assumed we weren&rsquo;t allowed to leave. So I kind of expected that I&rsquo;d be stopped by guards or something. </p>
<p>I was standing in the parking lot, fumbling with my keys, when I saw one of the Brothers walk by. </p>
<p>He shook his head at me. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t leave, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you gonna try to stop me?&rdquo; I asked him, getting into my psychic kung-fu stance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No no, nothing like that,&rdquo; he said as a butterfly landed on his head, &ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s impossible to leave. There&rsquo;s nothing outside of it. It&rsquo;s the whole universe.&rdquo;</p>
