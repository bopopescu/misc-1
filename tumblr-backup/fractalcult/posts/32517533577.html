<h2>Cult Leader</h2>
<p>Bung Fu the Fool been in the Fractal Cult for a few weeks but never seen the person in charge of it. Nevertheless, he had been hearing a lot of talk about a Leader. He started asking around about the guy, hoping to meet him in the flesh.</p>
<p>After a few days, Bung Fu concluded that <em>nobody</em> in the Fractal Cult has actually met the Leader in person. Or if they have, they have been instructed to be really dodgy about it. They always said these vague mystical things about him like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is greater than all of us,&rdquo; or</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you eat, you feed the leader,&quot; </p>
<p>and most infuriating of all, &quot;The Leader transcends the duality of self and the other.&quot; </p>
<p><em>What the fuck does that even mean?</em> Bung Fu cursed to himself as he searched. <em>Bullshit cult probably doesn&rsquo;t even have a leader.</em></p>
<p>Finally, Bung Fu got a hold of his old friend, the monk Nopants. Specifically, he got ahold of his neck and slapped him, &quot;Who is in charge of this cult? Give it to me straight! I&rsquo;ve gotta know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nopants calmly answered, &ldquo;Let me ask you this - who would the cells in your body say is their Leader?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, me,&rdquo; said Bung Fu quickly.</p>
<p>Nopants stuck out his tongue. &ldquo;Slow down. Listen - the person who just said &lsquo;me&rsquo;&hellip; your cells have never met that jerk cult leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bung Fu dropped the monk and slapped his forehead. Nopants muttered to himself, &ldquo;And if they ever did meet him, they&rsquo;d probably grab him by the collar and slap him.&quot; </p>
<p>          It took a few hours, but eventually Bung Fu was enlightened. </p>
