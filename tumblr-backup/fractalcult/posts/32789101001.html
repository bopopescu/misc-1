<blockquote><p>This next part I don&rsquo;t remember so hot. All I know is I got up from the bed, like I was going down to the can or something, and I walked over to the TV set and turned it on to a dead channel-white noise at maximum decibels. Only, I missed. I didn&rsquo;t connect. This is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war. It probably hurt him a little bit, but not as much as I wanted. Not even the Sun God wants to watch. It probably would&rsquo;ve hurt him a lot, but I did it with my right hand, and I can&rsquo;t make a good fist with that hand. Don&rsquo;t waste any time with cheap shucks and misdemeanors. Go straight for the jugular. Get right into felonies.</p></blockquote>
