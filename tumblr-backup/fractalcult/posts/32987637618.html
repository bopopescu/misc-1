<p>Will Turner: The Black Pearl?<br>
Jack Sparrow: Do you want to know what it is?<br>
 [Will Turner nods]<br>
Jack Sparrow: The Black Pearl is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. The drink would not satisfy. Food turned to ash in our mouths. And all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay thy taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over thy eyes to blind you from the truth.<br>
Will Turner: What truth?<br>
Jack Sparrow: That you are a slave, Will Turner. Like everyone else you were born into bondage.<br>
Elizabeth Swann: You like pain? Try wearing a corset!<br>
Jack Sparrow: Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for thy mind. Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Black Pearl is. You have to see it for thyself. This is thy last chance. After this, there is no turning back. [opens hand, unveiling blue pill] You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in thy bed and believe whatever you want to believe. [opens hand, unveiling red pill] You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.<br>
Remember: all I'm offering is wearing a corset. Nothing more.<br>
 [Will Turner takes the red pill after a few moments of thought, and washes it down with a mouthful of water from the glass next to him]<br>
Jack Sparrow: Follow me.</p>
