<h2>Traditional Discordian Initiation</h2>
<p>Discordians are a sect of vagrant lunatics found in the Strange Times. When a fresh recruit is admitted into this fraternity, he is to take the following oath, administered by the principal maunder, after going through the annexed forms.<br/><br/>First, a new name is given him, by which he is ever after to be called; then standing up in the middle of the assembly, and directing his face to the dimber damber, or principal man of the gang, he disrobes unscrupulously. He then repeats the following oath, which is dictated to him by some experienced member of the fraternity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br/>I, Crank Cuffin, do swear to be a true brother, and that I will in all things obey the commands of the great tawney prince, and keep his council, and not divulge the secrets of my brethren, unless I do.<br/><br/>I will never leave nor forsake the company, but observe and keep all the times of appointment, either by day or night in every place whatever man.<br/><br/>I will not teach any one to cant, nor will I disclose any of our heinous mysteries to them.<br/><br/>I will take my spagmate&rsquo;s part against all that shall oppose him, or any of us, according to the utmost of my ability: nor will I suffer him, or any one belonging to us, to be abused by any strange abrams, rufflers, hookers, pailliards, cones, swaddlers, Irish toyles, swigmen, whip jacks, jarkmen, bawdy baskets, spags, clapper dogeons, cabbages, or curtails; but will defend him or them, as much as I can, against all other outliers or whatever. I will not conceal aught I win out of libkins, or from the ruffmans, but I will preserve it for the use of the company. Lastly, I will cleave to my doxy-wap stiffly, and will bring her duds, margery praters, goblers, grunting cheats, or tibs of the buttery, or any thing else I can come at, as winnings for her wappings.<br/><br/>Before the Goddess Eris, I Crank Cuffin, do herewith declare myself a brother of the legion of dynamic discord, hail hail hail hail hail Eris Eris Eris Eris ALL HAIL DISCORDIA!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/><br/>Then everybody else shouts: ALL HAIL DISCORDIA!</p>
