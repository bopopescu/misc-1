<h2>With regards to plantains.</h2>
<p>Six zucchini in, and Tom Traubert still walked into worlds unknown. They&rsquo;ve forgotten ourselves, so that can be thrown out in the garbage; the cats will eat it all, and trombones will cry for a fresh loaf of bread. With pants of patent-polyester, the Pope of Pontchartrain purchased a pearlescent porkpie for Duchess Anastasia. The matter is broken, but we&rsquo;ve put it back together with a little epoxy and differential equations.</p>
<p>In a word, or so it&rsquo;s been said, anachronism is a waltzing sheep in the Amazon. A sixth of whiskey makes for a solution, i.e., a precipitate, when applied to 2:00 AM on Christmas Island. There is a heart, but it&rsquo;s made of boot-leather and was crushed under John Galt&rsquo;s loquacious speech; Germans call it French, but this chicken dropped firebombs in the laundromat on Broadway street. The matter is obsolete, and a new one should arrive in six to eight months.</p>
<p>As we waited, a thin man appeared in the doorway, and I could feel the moss growing under my fingernails and in my gallbladder. Rubber giraffes ran amok in the streets of New Delhi and Sardinia, but only if schmaltz is for sissies. Sad pictures are playing on the jukebox in an old diner in New York. The coffee came too late for dinner, but too early for the pie, and reminded everyone of bad checks and rainbows. The matter is on fire, but there&rsquo;s a Chinese fire drill in Buenos Aires, so you should be safe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s last call in the thought bar, and the faces all around are showing old cartoons from Michio Kaku&rsquo;s childhood. Noir is a bullet in Ursa Major, and the breakfast cereal is screaming “Leave us alone,” still narrowing for morbidity. Friendship is the MacGuffin of the day, ironically enough; a red laser-pointer dot glows on the assassin&rsquo;s head, and a tortoise ate the trigger and the beef. The matter is derelict, but six weeks of rehab and six years in the cheese cave will change that.</p>
<p>Cellar door is the opiate of the koi fish, leaving only pastrami and Get-Well-Soon cards. The smokehouse is pumping out the sordid newsletters and the child is not yours. Business cards bearing the moniker “Carnivorous consolidation leads only to flash drives,” in a broad portrait of pastiche as a goddess of sea salt and used car lots. The matter is on the run, but special forces units in eight languages are hunting it down.</p>
<p>For the few who read between the lines, you&rsquo;ll find chocolate novelties and digital inputs. Sob into warm, fresh pillows and listen to the children; transgendered angels tap out jazz rhythms on a million strings. Poetry is in the lung of Achilles, but three replicas swim in jello with bombast and no respect for the laws of man or cat. The matter has been copy-edited and fact-checked, and will be published in the next issue.</p>
