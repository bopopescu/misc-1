<h2><a href="http://firstchurchofspacejesus.blogspot.com/2010/06/infictive-infections-and-working.html">Infictive Infections and Working Subversions</a></h2>
<p><span>An </span><a href="http://chaosmarxism.blogspot.com/2009/02/im-goddamned-batman.html">excellent post</a><span> by Deloras at Chaos Marxism has sparked </span><a href="http://irreality.me/x/res/1276.html">much</a><span></span><a href="http://irreality.me/x/res/1354.html">discussion</a><span>, and I suppose I should probably expand and clarify my $0.02 on the subject.</span><br/><br/><span>We live mostly not in reality, but in fictional projections of our models of reality. Whenever we make a conscious decision, we are consulting models of reality formed from several sources of information:</span><br/><span>1) previous direct experience in analogous situations</span><br/><span>2) indirect experience of analogous situations (stories)</span><br/><span>3) the interaction between existing models and new experiences (received directly or indirectly) </span><em>as they interacted at the time of absorption</em><br/><br/><span>Now, our models occasionally reject direct experience that conflicts completely with our models. This is useful; our sense organs produce spurious noise much of the time, and so it is very important in a life-or-death situation to have the kind of brain function that will tell you that the shape in the corner of the room is NOT a ghost or a shroud-eater or some even-scarier beast you have been raised to think does not exist, since otherwise you may run into the mouth of a more immediate danger while fleeing a chimera. The veto mechanism can be abused, as is seen in practice by many highly dogmatic systems of thought (obvious examples include the creationists, the Randites, the Randiites, the lifestyle canon-marxists, apple fans, microsoft fans, linux fans, breatharians, and fluffybunny pagan types, but pretty much any subculture with a name consists partially if not mostly of people who will ignore reality that conflicts with their pet models).</span><br/><br/><span>There are other ways these systems can be hacked, though. Robert Anton Wilson&rsquo;s epistemological pan-agnosticism, </span><a href="http://chaosmarxism.blogspot.com/2009/08/cleavage.html">like some less-metaphorical Neo, tries to save people from their own nervous system firewalls by demonstrating how much nonsense they can generate</a><span>. Unfortunately, dogmatic memeplexes have some pretty intense and potent self-defense systems. </span><a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4677263347_d7f56ee6a0_o.jpg">Cognitive dissonance may not be a good route either.</a><span> While I am all for people freeing their minds, a grass-roots free-your-mind movement is probably destined for as much success as the </span><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Yippieflag.gif/200px-Yippieflag.gif">yippie movement&rsquo;s grassroots free-your-mind movement</a><span>; trickle-up enlightenment is likely to be blocked subconsciously by the memeplexes that have already infiltrated the highest levels of society. On the other hand, </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing#Notable_examples">the most active adepts in today&rsquo;s world</a><span> </span><a href="http://chaosmarxism.blogspot.com/2009/09/o-wad-some-power-giftie-gie-us.html">have already realized how to get people to suspend disbelief</a><span> long enough to feed them </span><a href="http://picturebook.nothingness.org/pbook/mrblock/display/1">autotoxic memeplexes</a><span>.</span><br/><br/><span>Everyone partakes of fiction, more or less. Fiction provides </span><a href="http://tvtropes.org/">a language in which the shorthand forms of the everyday umwelt can be slipped to the uninitiated</a><span>, and designed in such a way that subversions should slip under the radar. All communication is subversion in a sense, and the spectacle can be infected in such a way that it will promote the manipulation of reality tunnels. Like any other living creature, the spectacle will do anything to survive, or die trying. </span><a href="http://www.infictive.com/index.php?title=Where_The_Name_Comes_From">The infectious detournment of fiction made possible by the extensive classification by tropers of the sub-liminal language of modern narrative will not only affect fiction but affect reality</a><span>.</span><br/><br/><span>There are side notes to this, which might be best explored later. I will note them now:</span><br/><span>1) One can utilize tvtropes outside of the standard narrative hypersigil workings, since these documents show correlations between entities, qualities, and rituals, as understood under the radar by the hoi polloi.</span><br/><span>2) Fiction affects reality through methods not directly mediated by humans. The most obvious example is google-bombing, which on a much more subtle level any piece of fiction that is archived by a search engine as sophisticated as google&rsquo;s will end up doing to some extent &ndash; slightly modifying the results of searches, ad targeting, and even translations.</span><br/><span>3) TvTropes itself is highly mutable. Any tvtropes-inspired subversion that gains notability will eventually modify tvtropes itself, and even non-notable narratives can subvert pieces of the narrative spectacle.</span></p>
