<h2>Another rant about skepticism</h2>
<p>Opposing homeopathy (or opposing some arbitrary other specific idea at odds with evidence) does not constitute skepticism. While skeptics tend to side with evidence against blind faith, coincidentally siding with evidence is not the same as systematically siding with evidence. A lot of self-proclaimed skeptics aren&rsquo;t actually skeptical at all; they just have a decent track record by siding with the majority opinion of a relatively educated subculture, as opposed to actually actively questioning their own beliefs (a fundamental part of skepticism). They are not fundamentally more skeptical than the members of a less educated culture that have blind faith in those things &lsquo;skeptics&rsquo; rail against.</p>
<p>Neither is disbelief skepticism. One who believes that the moon is not real is not in fact a skeptic; he&rsquo;s just kind of strange. Just because you don&rsquo;t believe in something doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re skeptical of it. One is only skeptical when one&rsquo;s belief or disbelief is cemented in evidence. One who disbelieves in a thing because there is no evidence for or against it isn&rsquo;t skeptical; he&rsquo;s just a bit dim, and wouldn&rsquo;t pass a class in formal logic.</p>

<p>Charles Fort was far more of a skeptic than Dawkins will ever be.</p>
