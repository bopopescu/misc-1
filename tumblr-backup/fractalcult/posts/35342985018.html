<h2>A Meditation on Slacktivism</h2>
<p>Bung Fu entered the mojo dojo, where Nopants was practicing his google-katas.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Brother Nopants,&rdquo; said Bung Fu, &ldquo;Social Media is tiresome. Everybody&rsquo;s standing on soapboxbook, tweeting about causes, everybody&rsquo;s signing petitions, everybody&rsquo;s reaching towards unity &hellip; while sitting still. Some people call it &lsquo;slacktivism&rsquo; - a way of making yourself feel like you&rsquo;re helping without actually doing anything. Is it wasted energy?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Nopants cleared his cache and said, &ldquo;You are correct in this, Bung Fu - the individual has little power over the group. To change a group, you must act on a group scale.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Bung Fu smiled, &ldquo;So posting about politics and social justice is just an ego game, it makes the individual feel good but doesn&rsquo;t help the group?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Brother Nopants shook his head and spoke slowly, &ldquo;The group and the individual are the same. The group reaches for unity through its members. The individual posts are powerless, but as a group&hellip;&rdquo;<br/><br/>Bung Fu sat in silence for some time. <br/><br/><br/><br/>&ldquo;Is the individual really so powerless?&rdquo; asked Bung Fu.<br/><br/>Nopants shook his head again, &ldquo;Some are, because many groups are not positioned to affect each other. But as I said, the individual and the group are the same. Even your individual question carries a group&rsquo;s energy.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Which group?&rdquo; asked Bung Fu.<br/><br/>&ldquo;As an individual&rdquo; replied the monk, &ldquo;you have the power to choose.&rdquo;</p>
