<p><strong>Cthonic Chronos</strong></p>
<p>The Greeks had a very Lovecraftian view of time, as personified by Chronos. A monstrous inevitability, time has not only eaten the past, but will eat the future, and everything it ate was in some sense its descendant. Hungry and ineffable, this personification of entropy is much more frightening than Maxwell&rsquo;s Demon (who personified negentropy).</p>
<p>Remember: one day, unexpectedly, time will eat you. It cannot be predicted or avoided, so try to live your life so that when the final boss of the universe defeats you, your last thoughts are &ldquo;fuck yeah, that was worthwhile&rdquo;.</p>
