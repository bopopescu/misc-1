<h2>Chao Bellied Sneetches</h2>
<p>Hi guys! Just wanted to give you a quick update about how things are going at <strong>the fractal cult</strong>. It&rsquo;s been &hellip; interesting. About two weeks ago, everybody divided up into camps and moved into the north and south wings of the monastery. It was pretty tense for a while. </p>
<p>Basically, despite this cult being specifically non-religious, everybody here is a <a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/43.php">Discordian Pope</a>. So nobody is under each other&rsquo;s authority, and that creates this oppressive sense of responsibility. Everybody owns the cult. And since they don&rsquo;t want to be associated with anything shitty, they get kind of defensive about it. <em>Crazy</em> defensive.  </p>
<p>There are a lot of creative types here, and apparently that means they have to be expressing themselves all the goddamn time or they&rsquo;ll <em>wilt</em> or something maudlin like that. So after an hour of argument we finally concluded (notice I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;agreed&rdquo;) that we should put on a play. Then, after another hour of argument, we agreed (but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a <em>c</em>onclusion) that we should do <em>The Sneetches</em> by Dr. Seuss.</p>
<p>Everybody was happy. It was a wonderful moment. It was quiet and everybody was smiling. I enjoyed it while it lasted.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the serenity and harmony was decimated by the sound &ldquo;admission fee?&rdquo; passing between somebody&rsquo;s lips. The entire building immediately exploded with flaming shit. There was a huge argument about money and labor and half the cast made a big scene and quit. Then they came back so they could shout more. Eventually this one guy said he&rsquo;d put in all the money and take responsibility for the play, and I guess that solved things, because now he was the Director and everybody calmed down. But only a little.</p>
<p>The Director was excited! He said he wanted to do the costumes this certain way, (Spandex) and a bunch of people flipped the fuck out said they didn&rsquo;t want to be in the play if it had spandex because it will make us look awful and the audience will judge us. The Sneetches had to wear big foam bodysuits which concealed the actor&rsquo;s identity or they&rsquo;d drop out. </p>
<p>The Director got really frustrated because he had basically paid for the thing, and he had always wanted to do a spandex play. Even if some of the cast would look pretty bad in spandex, he thought it would be honest. Somebody said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going to tarnish this Seuss&rsquo; <em>work of art</em> with this amateur regional theater bullshit.&rdquo; That was followed by a wave of groaning and eye rolling. And that&rsquo;s when people started picking sides and moving their stuff into bedrooms on the other side of the Monastery and muttering under their breath all day.</p>
<p>On day two, somebody got peed on.</p>
<p>On day three, somebody was thrown from the balcony and he got a concussion.</p>
<p>Then they peed on him.</p>
<p>On day four, there were peace talks. Except that&rsquo;s a rather generous usage of the word. More accurately, you could call them <em>I have to get this shit off my chest</em> talks. There were tears. Oh there were tears.</p>
<p>At about 11 PM on day four, we reached an agreement to cancel the play and never talk about plays again. Ever.</p>
<p>If this rule was broken, we would all share the punishment: having to go through this entire debacle again.</p>
<p>Somebody took it one step further and said &ldquo;Okay here&rsquo;s an idea. No more group projects. Everybody do your own individual thing, team up with others if you want, but trying to please everybody here is a huge waste of time.&rdquo; Everybody started nodding, that sounds like a good idea, then one guy said &ldquo;<em>Fuck that, you&rsquo;re not the boss of me</em>,&rdquo; and then the shouting started, and totally out of the blue, a stream of hot pee blasted across my cheek, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been holed up in the bathroom with my laptop since yesterday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to hear weird noises outside the door.</p>
<p>No.. Instruments? No no&hellip; LOTS of instruments?? This is fucked up. After all that drama about drama, please tell me we&rsquo;re not starting a big full-cult band.</p>
<p>Please tell me that? </p>
<p>Because seriously&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;I have no idea where I left my harmonica.</p>
