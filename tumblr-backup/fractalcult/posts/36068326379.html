<p><strong>&ldquo;Pissing on your idea&rdquo;</strong> is the Seth Godin term for when somebody wants to modify your idea before they&rsquo;ll support it. <em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, you just need to change it like this&rdquo;&hellip;</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a dog marking territory.</p>
<p>By changing it, they are investing their ego into the idea. Their hope is that by aligning the idea with their own goals, it becomes more attractive, more worthy of their support.</p>
<p>Seth says: don&rsquo;t sweat it&hellip; If you care about your idea, and you want it to grow, LET people piss on it (if that&rsquo;s what it takes to get their support). <strong>That is how small ideas grow into big ideas, they become everybody&rsquo;s territory.</strong></p>
<p>Robert Anton Wilson also thinks about ideas in terms of territory, but he doesn&rsquo;t romanticize the collaborative process. He agrees that ideas are the current incarnation of territory. All our primate territory-guarding behaviors, hard wired into our nervous system, have been adapted to do battle in a theater of ideas. Many of our conversations are the exact same behavior you see in a junkyard dog barking at strangers who smell like Other territory. Not very romantic, no?</p>
<p>Either way, they agree on this:</p>
<p><strong>Ideas are excrement</strong></p>
