<p><img src="../media/tumblr_me5u3ixECX1r6wxd1.png"/>The <strong>Fractal Cult</strong> is approaching 100 followers, so I figured I&rsquo;d say Hi. So who are we?</p>
<p>FRACTAL CULT is a <a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/31.php">Discordian Cabal</a>. There&rsquo;s about 20 of us. We have little in common, but we are all part of the same fractal. And we&rsquo;re all on the creative trip. AND LATER WE ARE DRINKING KOOL AID TOGETHER.</p>
<p>FRACTAL CULT is a tumblr blog which posts only original content. No reposts unless the content was created by a group member. </p>
<p>If you look closely at FRACTAL CULT, you can see that its parts are made of the whole FRACTAL CULT. </p>
<p>My name is <a href="http://cramulus.tumblr.com">Cramulus</a> and I kicked off this thing because I wanted (a) to discover if there was a Discordian presence on tumblr and (b) if there are Discordians and other spags on tumblr, I wanted to play with them, including &copy; collaboration (d) belonging to a cult, or (e) everybody just do their own thing (f) that&rsquo;s cool too (g) I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll let us leave, and anyway (h) I don&rsquo;t remember what the outside word is like. I suspect there is no outside world anymore. (i) the last frontiers are mental landscapes (j) there is only the umbra which the macrocosm casts upon the microcosm (k) kopyleft all rites reversed hail eris 23 skidoo </p>
