<p>In a<strong> Fractal Cult Meditation</strong>, you focus on the structural similarities between the small and the large, the internal and the external.</p>
<p>I find it helps to focus your attention on a fractal image, but you don&rsquo;t have to be too picky - fractals are everywhere.</p>
<p>Note the patterns of urban life: they are much like the patterns of the body. The circulatory system brings nutrients to your tissue, just as a street brings customers to a store front. There is a <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyh0poWf1O1r10jfjo1_500.gif">cyclical force</a> which pumps everything along.</p>
<p>That force feels like <em>action</em>, then rest. <em>Action</em>, then rest. <em>Action</em>, then rest&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Work</em>, weekend, <em>work</em>, weekend, <em>work</em>, weekend&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Green light</em>, red light, g<em>reen light</em>, red light, g<em>reen light</em>, red light&hellip; </p>
<p>Sometimes it sounds like this: &ldquo;<em>thesis</em>, antithesis, <em>synth</em>esis&hellip; <em>thesis</em>, antithesis, <em>synth</em>esis&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Lub</em>-dub, <em>lub</em>-dub, <em>lub</em>-dub&hellip;</p>
<p>Fellow explorer, understand this!</p>
<p>The pulse of your body, the pulse of creativity, and the pulse of the city <strong>originate from the same source</strong>. They are echoes of the same rhythm. The only difference is the level of magnification.</p>
<p>You are a cell in the world&rsquo;s body. Relationships are tissue. Organizations are organs. </p>
<p>When something moves you, it&rsquo;s also moving your city, it&rsquo;s also moving the nation, it&rsquo;s also moving the world. </p>
<p>This <em>mysterious pulse</em> manifests differently elsewhere in the fractal. Along the Mandelbrot coastline, all the peninsulas and capes and other protrusions are unique, though structurally similar. </p>
<p>When you experience this connection, you begin to feel the pulse everywhere. Even microscopic experiences during your day carry the full tidal force of the entire cosmos.</p>
<p>You are waiting at a red traffic light.  You sense it&rsquo;s about to turn green. And something inside you takes its foot off the break.</p>
<p>And then the crowd surges forward into the light.</p>
