<p>It has been more than a hundred years since the fundamentals of quantum theory have been discovered. Why haven&rsquo;t people internalized it yet?</p>
<p>People talk about it. It still gets a lot of press, and it is still treated as though it&rsquo;s new. (It, along with relativistic physics, was wrapped into the name &ldquo;new physics&rdquo; in the 60s, when it was merely 50 years old instead of 100.) But, their comments (even the ones by physicists) tend to come down to: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s strange and I don&rsquo;t really get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>We have devices that work based on the principles of QM, and we use them daily. Solar cells? QM. 3d movies? QM. Transistors? QM. Cathode ray tubes? QM. How the hell are we going to continue to make basic technical advances when we keep telling ourselves that nobody can develop an intuitive feel for the part of science upon which our basic technical advances have been built since the 1920s?</p>
<p>People say it's counter-intuitive  So what? Plenty of people believe plenty of counter-intuitive things. For instance, you may have heard that the earth is round, and it is moving through space. Plenty of people believe counter-intuitive things that aren&rsquo;t even held up by evidence (transubstantiation, the trinity, the hollow earth, the principle of homeopathy, the myth of progress, the coming of the eschaton&hellip;) People are perfectly capable of adopting, and then operating within the framework of, counter-intuitive models of the world, and QM does not involve the kind of evidence-filtering and umwelt-warping that far more popular world-models do.</p>
<p>People say it&rsquo;s mathy. Well, so what? Every time you play tug of war, you are operating on a learned intuition about the behavior of force vectors. Every time you take a step, you are operating on learned intuitions about the acceleration of objects toward earth, and the forces necessary to counter that, and the side effects of having those forces at various angles. We do a lot of math intuitively, and QM is not fundamentally harder. (There&rsquo;s probability involved. So? You decide whether or not to leave your house, or cross the street, or buy a new cell phone, based on estimations of likelihoods and their interactions.)</p>
<p>I suspect that people avoid QM because they are convinced that it is much harder than the rest of physics, and that they believe this because they have heard things said fifty to a hundred years ago by physicists who hadn&rsquo;t finished internalizing it. The new generation of physicists who really comprehended this stuff in their gut never came.</p>
<p>If you care about technological progress, avoid telling people that QM is impossible.</p>
