<h2>2030</h2>
<p>Various neural interfaces have been available for decades. Every couple years we get a news report about how somebody&rsquo;s controlling a car or a wheelchair or a keyboard or a mouse with their brain &ldquo;for the first time&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s almost precisely the same article as the one from two years ago with the names changed. But, the plain fact is that neural interfaces of various types are mature but not quite useful technology, on the level perhaps of flying cars (which have been on the market, consistently, since the 30s &ndash; with essentially no commercial success)&hellip; up until the last few years, when you started being able to buy EEG machines for a hundred bucks from Amazon and use them to play FPSes.</p>

<p>Right now, neural interfaces are where digital watches were in 1975 (when Sir Clive Sinclair introduced a digital watch kit for a thousand bucks that didn&rsquo;t have seconds and couldn&rsquo;t be easily set). But, by 1985, digital watches were a quotidian technology, and you weren&rsquo;t cool unless yours had a calculator on it. I expect that various neural interface technologies will follow the same curve, instead of following the personal computer curve, because once the cool factor wears off they are more useful for most of us than flying cars but still of limited and well-defined utility (unlike computers).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t suspect that most of us will be implanting neural interfaces in 2030, although some people have been since the 80s. I suspect that magnet implants (currently pretty fringe) will be as common in 2030 as nipple piercings are today, and that they will be far more common than wet wires. But, non-invasive neural interfaces are already more common than magnet implants, and the kids that received the EEG equivalent of the Commodore VIC-20 a couple years ago are going to be adults with disposable incomes and no memories of a world prior to the release of the third Matrix movie in 2030. The idea that neural interfaces exist and work flakily will be implanted into them as much as the Furby implanted ideas about social robotics into my generation.</p>
