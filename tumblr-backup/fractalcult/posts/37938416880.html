<h2>A public service announcement</h2>
<p>Feeling bad about a tragedy does not make you special. In fact, damn near everybody feels bad when something almost universally terrible happens. It does not help anybody to express how bad you feel that something bad happens. In fact, it merely serves to warp the popular understanding of what happened and discourage rational analysis of the subject by making it (however horrible it was) seem more horrible than it was. If you care about these things not happening, the very worst thing you can do is spend a week or two shouting meaningless hyperbole into the vast echo chamber of the internet about how bad it was. The best case scenario resulting from a general outcry is that nothing of significance is done, and the worse case scenario is that something completely ludicrous (like banning costumes in movie theatres, wide-scale discrimination against bald schizophrenics, and encouraging eleven years of letting the feds read the list of books you checked out of the library and entrap a bunch of unfortunate incompetents into terrorism convictions) will become seen as an acceptable solution.</p>
<p>I know that people aren&rsquo;t going to read and accept my proposal. I fully expect that several people will shout at me for being insensitive. My problem is maybe that I&rsquo;m too sensitive: I really don&rsquo;t want to feel bad for several weeks just because people won&rsquo;t shut up about something that they have no intent on attempting to fix in any kind of practical way.</p>
<p>If you are engaging in rational and productive discourse, backed up by data, and doing so in private until you have something meaningful to say about the subject, then I applaud you: you are doing precisely what most of the internet is incapable of doing, which is to stop competing to be the most outraged person in the room.</p>
