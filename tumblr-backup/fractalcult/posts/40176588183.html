<blockquote><p>From where I&rsquo;m sitting in January 2013, I think the concept of utopia/dystopia is a form of apocalyptic thought - a catalytic fiction. I think we need a word for a world which has utopic and dystopic properties simultaneously. </p>

<p>Utopia and Dystopia have a sort of symbiotic relationship, no? Safety and privacy. Capitalism creates both wealth and sweatshops. The framers of the constitution had to put in safeguards to keep the newly minted American people from democratically electing King George. </p>

<p>I think Utopia and Dystopia are more or less the same elephant felt from different angles.</p></blockquote>
