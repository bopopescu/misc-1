<h2>The Age of Cancer - The Far Shore of Madness</h2>
<p><strong>A missive from Saint Amir Zetathustra, Heretic</strong></p>
<p>Amir strode through the Theater in his holy garb (which he could no longer put through a washing machine after finally attaching the studs like he&rsquo;d meant to, though there was still an ugly blood stain on the sleeve from where he&rsquo;d wiped a nosebleed last June). He saw the Mosh, and saw that it was Pretty Crappy, As Usual, so he abstained and went to the bar for overpriced bourbon shots and the wisdom of wine. There, he met a sage who could not stay on his stool, instead preferring to clutch tightly to the bar. Amir listened while the sage spoke to a few wary followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The age of Aquarius is not coming; we&rsquo;re coming up on the age of Cancer.</p>
<p>I mean, look at it - cancer everywhere! Your bed might give you cancer. The things used to make your phone will give you cancer. City&rsquo;s tearing down an old building near your house? Good luck not getting cancer!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s cancer in your food, cancer in your genes, cancer in everything, everywhere.</p>
<p>Big Money is, as we all know, tied to the Illuminati, or if I am to reveal their True Name, the OBSCURA!!!, the Slavers and Obscurers of Old Atlantis. They&rsquo;ve been running guns to keep our claws sharp, keep us hiding in our armored shells instead of coming out and connecting and loving and feeling the Sun - the truth and the light and the bringer of life itself - on our skin. Now they seek to wither us in our shells with their cancers, boil us up, and eat us for dinner! And without even the courtesy of garlic butter and white wine!</p>
<p>A few Bringers of Light and Truth in Europe figured out what was going on, and they&rsquo;re banning the Industrial Cancers, but at a cost. Their fears and efforts drive them further into their shells - a long life, never seeing the sun.</p>
<p>In America, the state of California is doing its part to warn us all. &quot;THIS PRODUCT IS KNOWN BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER.&rdquo; We owe them our lives - we&rsquo;d all be Sickly Slaves to the Obscura Illuminati by now.</p>
<p>But still, cancer is spreading, and Cancer is coming. The Great Crab grows power as Its followers worship. We can only delay, as things are, not change our fate or prevent the Crab&rsquo;s Reckoning.</p>
<p>The solution?</p>
<p>Get paranoid.</p>
<p>Get really paranoid.</p>
<p>Grow and foster and feed your paranoia and fear and let it blossom into madness. Cross the line into madness, and forge on.</p>
<p>When you come to the Far Shore of Madness, you will see the Great Crab, and you will know what you must do.</p>
<p>What must you do? Fucked if I know, man, I&rsquo;m just the janitor.&ldquo;</p>
<p>The sage&rsquo;s companions left for the Mosh, scoffing at their friend&rsquo;s words.  But Amir saw the strange wisdom in what had been slurred, so he bought the sage another beer.</p>
<p>The sage threw up on Amir&rsquo;s shoes and was promptly removed from the building.</p>
<p>Amir felt enlightened. </p>
<p>PER METUM AD INSANIA. PER INSANIA AD VERITAS.</p>
<p>Through Fear into Madness. Through Madness into Truth.</p>

<p>Note: The sage&rsquo;s missive was approximately reconstructed from notes taken by Amir on the back of a receipt using a pen he nicked from the bartender. The receipt was later used to start a bonfire. The fate of the pen is unknown.</p>
