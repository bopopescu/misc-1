<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the second part of the Law of 5s</strong>: {spoiler alert}<br/><br/>If you look for 5s, you find 5s. But let&rsquo;s be clear, there is *nothing* mystical about the numbers 5 or 23. If we had six fingers, it would be called the law of sixes. Those numbers are just a way of teaching you about &ldquo;confirmation bias&rdquo;. When you go hunting through the Chaos for a signal, you will find that signal.<br/><br/>If you look for evidence that people are shitheads, you will find it. If you look for evidence that people are awesome, you will find it.<br/><br/>A lot of people are miserable because they hunt for reasons to be miserable. They keep finding confirmation for their belief that people are worthless and the world sucks. But a lot of people are having great adventures every day because they have learned to see them everywhere.<br/><br/>A friend of mine saw a pack of pingpong balls and a sharpie and he saw something we didn&rsquo;t. He sliced the pingpong balls in half and drew eyes on them, poked out a hole in the pupil to see through, then jammed them onto his face. Fucking hysterical, we were giggling for hours drawing different eyes and making faces at each other. We could take a lesson from him, that&rsquo;s some high level monk shit.<br/><br/><strong>two very useful links on this topic:</strong><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias</a><br/><a href="http://deoxy.org/wiki/The_Thinker_and_the_Prover">http://deoxy.org/wiki/The_Thinker_and_the_Prover</a></p>
