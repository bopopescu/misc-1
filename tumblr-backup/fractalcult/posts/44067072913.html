<h2>The Society of the Spectacle has its demands too</h2>
<p>It demands your attention.</p>
<p>It demands that you state your position in the form of a sound-byte which can be re-contextualized by another sound-byte.</p>
<p>It demands a remake of yesteryear’s summer blockbuster, the one with the hairy hippies on drums and mud, but with this year’s celebrities.</p>
<p>It wants to roll up your energy and sell it to kids on the street corner in a dime bag they have to hide from their parents.</p>
<p>It demands that you smoke that energy in secret and get all excited, fuzzy headed, forgetful, then you want more, and it’s got some, but the next hit’s gonna cost you.</p>
<p>It demands a glass jar full of passion, on display, so we can see the passion through the glass without getting any on our hands.</p>
<p>It demands that by end of the episode, we return to the nuclear sitcom family you saw in the opening credits.</p>
<p>It demands that you stop bringing up its disease, because that is embarrassing to both parties.</p>
<p>It demands your attention to these issues right now, before it listens to you.</p>
<p>It demands that you stop talking over it.</p>
