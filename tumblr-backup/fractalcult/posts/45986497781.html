<blockquote><p>From my experience it seems all open organizations follow the same path: </p>

<p>- At the beginning, a small, consistent and aligned community of people start a project in a fully transparent and open way</p>

<p>- The project grows, others are joining. Participants’ objectives start to differ more, the alignment level goes down</p>

<p>- Processes and hierarchies are put in place to formalize things that were previously happening informally</p>

<p>- As problems continue to grow, openness is scaled back and more restrictions are put in place</p>

<p>- Early adopters leave out of frustration, referring to the old days as much better</p>

<p>- A certain level of maturity is reached, made of a mix of open and formal processes</p></blockquote>
