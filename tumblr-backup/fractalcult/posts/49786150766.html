<h2>Consciousness Exercise</h2>
<p>So this is a fun exercise. Start from a single thought. Keep going, stream-of-consciousness style, until you figure out what Discordia means to you. Post the whole thought process in whatever medium you like.<br/>My example is below the cut. </p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>Feed, breed, raise chaos. The Chaos of the new form is fed on the old forms; feed it well on interesting and worthwhile things and your chaos will be compelling. Feed it on dreck and drudgery and dullardry and the days of delusion slipping from the cradle to the chains of the slave, to an ill-earned outmode abode in the grave, and your chaos will still be chaos and it may appeal to those who need it more. So is it better to compel with beauty and complexity and art, or is it better to feed and breed and meet the need? Does commodity cheapen chaos? Does commodity cheapen art? What is value? What do you value? What do I value? I value originality. I value style - auteur. I value vision, and I like it very big or very small and almost nowhere in between. Telescopes or microscopes; my jelly and water camera is my own, and I don&rsquo;t need yours. I like significance and beauty and life and death and love and hate, passion fulfilled or denied, honesty and intention or evil intention; if I want a character poisoned by its own stupidity and devoid of poetry, I&rsquo;ll look around with jelly cameras and meat refractors and reflectors and by Eris I will see all of that I need. Reality is poetry, but art is poetry distilled. Taste the poetry in the everyday if you can. Art is life is poetry is music is the visual is the aural is the kinesthetic is everything and nothing and it is all chaos. <br/>Taste the chaos. Develop a taste for chaos in others.<br/>That is my purpose. That is what Discord means to me.</p>
