<h2>On Writing Discordian Lit</h2>
<p>We Discordians are all holy as fuck, and we have a direct line to Eris (dunno if she actually listens to these voice mails though). <br/><br/>That being said, there&rsquo;s a lot of Discordian works that are essentially self-help books written by people who shouldn&rsquo;t be giving advice to anybody. <br/><br/>There&rsquo;s also a lot of hmmm, let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;low-effort&rdquo; discordian lit,where somebody sat down and mashed the keyboard for 15 minutes, copy and pasted a bunch of kopyleft material they found, and said TA DAAA. <br/><br/>My advice to people adding to the Discordian library - think for yourself hard about it. Don&rsquo;t just spout crazy sounding stuff in the spirit of Mal and Omar. Try to bring something <strong>new</strong> to the table. Write something that <em>other</em> people will find interesting, useful, challenging, whatever &ndash; but be original, take your time, and make a mark nobody&rsquo;s made before.</p>
