<h2>Guided meditation</h2>
<p>So what’s the point of guided meditation? I mean, isn’t it supposed to be a personal journey to enlightenment? Well, that’s the stated purpose at least.<br/>
The problem is that breaking out of a well established pattern of thought is hard. It’s too easy to get caught in a cycle of self reinforcement. That’s not enlightenment, that’s masturbation. Mind, masturbation can be enlightening and meditative, but that’s another sect’s business, or at least another post. <br/>
Think of guided meditation as mediating with training wheels. Most people need a little help escaping the routine and the permitted, at least at first. It’s helpful to get exposed to an outside perspective to get started on the whole pondering thing. Even if it’s cockamamy nonsense, it’s a crack in the established structure. <br/>
It’s a start.<br/>
That’s why we do these prompted thought experiments in the fractal cult. We’re helping each other break out and Think. We’re raising questions that we might not otherwise think to ask. <br/>
Like “Why do these prompt things?”<br/>
