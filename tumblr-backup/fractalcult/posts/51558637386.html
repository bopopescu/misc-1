<h2>The Stupid Parable</h2>
<p>Nopants the Monk pulled himself up the mountain. It was a painful hike, and by the time he reached the top, he was bloody, out of breath, and fatigued. He turned and faced the valley below, and addressed the village he had come from.<br/><br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid, you&rsquo;re stupid!&rdquo; he preached.</p>
<p>His voice echoed all over creation. &ldquo;You are dumb and stupid, and in addition dumb, but <em>especially stupid.</em>&rdquo; No Pants panted, falling to his knees, out of breath.</p>
<p>Nopants felt a hand on his shoulder. Bung Fu the Fool was also on top of the mountain, apparently having taken the escalator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Bung Fu said to Nopants, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so obvious from up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nopants glared at Bung Fu. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an escalator??&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; said Bung Fu as he rode it back down on his way to lunch. &ldquo;See you around!&rdquo;</p>
