<h2>Don't you think some of this might be bullshit?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Privilege&rdquo;, &ldquo;cultural appropriation&rdquo;, &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;, &ldquo;social justice&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>Social Media is teaching very sophisticated ways to be offended.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing - victims of oppression need better tools and language to resolve injustices. Lets give a megaphone to the systemically silenced. <strong>Let&rsquo;s crowd-source a better world!</strong></p>
<p>But that same defensive language is constantly deployed in lesser battles. There are so many false alarms being sounded. This ultimately diminishes the power of that language.</p>

<p>The same pattern happened during the spiritual awakening of the 60s. Some cracks had developed in the white christian patriarchal hegemony, and hundreds of little religions were born. Being &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; was finally okay. Wiccans and Neodruids and flower children embraced alternative spirituality.</p>
<p>But the movement had no immune system. There were multiple people claiming to be the reincarnation of Cleopatra. There were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jdnvlrszds">UFO religions</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breatharians">Breatharians</a>. And a lot of people became very deluded. I mean, we&rsquo;ve all met the guy who considers himself an extremely powerful sorcerer, but in reality, his life is a mess?</p>
<p>The embrace of these alternative spiritual concepts needed to be coupled with a way of separating a useful belief from a useless belief. It&rsquo;s great that we&rsquo;re experimenting, but some of these people are <em>objectively wrong</em>, right? Let&rsquo;s be honest with ourselves: Not <em>every</em> belief is equal.</p>
<p>((As a historical aside, this is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism">Discordianism</a> came in. Mal and Omar hoped that a religion which was <em>explicitly false, to an obvious and laughable degree</em> would cause the neopagan movement to say &ldquo;Wait a minute, some of this is bullshit.&rdquo; &mdash;-which would make the movement grow stronger as a whole.))</p>
<p><strong>Internet social justice needs to develop a similar immune system.</strong> </p>
<p><a href="http://revladymal.tumblr.com/">Rev Ladymal</a> put it well: &ldquo;a<span id="53439192013_message_body"> very bizarre hivemind emerges on social networking sites like these&hellip;&rdquo; Certain groups legitimately endure hatred, and the magic of social media creates an atmosphere where that language of resistance can be shared. And applied to anything. Even when it isn&rsquo;t appropriate. &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; (Rev LadyMal continues) &ldquo;anyone expressing an opinion (i.e. <em>&lsquo;I don’t like liver.&rsquo;</em>) becomes an oppressor to liverphiles.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The folks hurt by this the most are those who live with being a legitimate oppressed group. This nonsense of couching an unpopular opinion into social justice rhetoric are indeed diminishing the power of real social justice.&rdquo;</span></p>
