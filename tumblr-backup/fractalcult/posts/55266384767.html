<h2>Hello there. :-) I was curious about the symbol I have been seeing, the "Strange Attractor of Chaos" I believe it's called with the Chaos Star and the Sacred Chao surrounded by 8 symbols. I know what each of the symbols "are", and where they come from. My question is why were those symbols chosen to be a part of the over all design? Thank ya in advance. :-D</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen several variations of the &lsquo;strange attractor of chaos&rsquo;, and they&rsquo;ve all chosen symbols related to irreligions or comic-fantasy/horror/conspiracy lit. Typically, you&rsquo;ll see either a Dobbshead or a pipe ideograph (from the Church of the Subgenius), the five-fingered hand of Eris (from Discordianism), and a representation of the Spaghetti Monster (from Pastafarianism). I have also seen the unicursal hexagram (from Thelema), a penny-farthing bicycle (from The Prisoner), the Yellow Sign (from various parts of the Lovecraft mythos), the horn (from Pynchon), and The Summoning Dark (from Discworld).</p>
