<h2>Deck Duel</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">A fighting game for 2-4 players using regular playing cards.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Setting Up: </strong>Each player is dealt a hand of cards and given some tokens to represent life points. One player is given an “initiative” marker.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a 2 person game, you get 5 cards and 5 life points.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a 3 person game, you get 6 cards and 6 life points.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a 4 person game, you get 7 cards and 7 life points.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Black cards represent kicks. Red cards represent punches. The card’s number indicates how strong the attack is.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Taking Turns:</strong> Play is divided into rounds. The player with the initiative marker acts first. Then, play goes to the left.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Attacking</strong>: On your turn, you may play one attack. This attack is applied to each opponent simultaneously. Each opponent may try to block it by throwing a card of the same color and an equal or higher number. For example, a red 5 can only be blocked by a red card of 5 or higher. If the attack is not blocked, the defender loses a life point.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Flying Attacks: </strong>If you have two cards of the same number (example, the two of spades and the two of hearts), you may use them together as a <em>flying attack</em>. Both cards in the flying attack deal 1 damage and must be blocked separately. If the defender can only block one of the cards, the attack deals 1 damage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Counter Attacks: </strong>If you block an attack using a card with the same number (for example, blocking a jack of clubs with a jack of spades), it is called a <em>counter attack</em>. The block card counts as an attack against the original attacker. He or she may attempt to block it as normal. You may not counter a flying attack.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>“Finish Him!” </strong>When a player runs out of life points, he or she is <em>dying</em>. The person who landed the final attack may immediately throw an attack as a “finishing move”. If the dying player block the finishing move, he or she survives the match but is still knocked out. If the dying player cannot block the finishing move, he or she is beheaded.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>At the end of the round</strong> (after everybody has taken a turn), draw cards until your hand is full again. The initiative marker is passed to the left.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>How to Win</strong>: You get one point for being the last player alive in a round. You lose a point for being beheaded. Play a few games to see who is the best fighter!</p>
