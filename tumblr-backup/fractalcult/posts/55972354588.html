<p>Fuck tags.</p>
<p>People are up in arms about a difference in how tag searching works. They are angry because they rely upon tag searching rather than organic discovery. Well, tag searching is broken — but tag searching, by its very nature, is inherently broken.</p>
<p>Tag searching (as opposed to tag clouds) is based upon the assumption that we can break down reality into a finite set of nouns small enough that a stranger can determine the noun s/he needs to find a thing s/he has never seen before, a priori. This works (to some degree) for simple things: search for cats, and you get cats. It works to the extent that people use tags consistently, and limit their tag use to a small number of near-universal tags. But, some genuinely important ideas cannot be trivially tagged. In fact, an idea that can be trivially tagged can be said to no longer be novel (and it is certainly the case that, except in the situation where posts are tagged wrong on purpose, a trivially taggable post’s content is already familiar to people browsing the tags). On top of this, tags are typically quite ambiguous: if I browse the ‘eye’ tag, I get pictures of people’s whole faces, pictures of pairs of eyes, pictures of single eyes, pictures of eyeballs that have been removed from their sockets, pictures of cats looking at cameras, drawings of animals with too many eyes, people dressed as eyes wearing top hats, and text posts about makeup. All of these things are legitimately eye-related, but none of them are what I want when I browse the tag, and someone more sensitive than I might be quite disturbed by many of the pictures.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why search engines for web pages and gopher sites moved from meta-tag searches to full text searches as soon as it was computationally feasible: categories are not a property of reality, and human languages (since they are intended for use in dealing with reality in those rare emergency situations when reality must be dealt with) are simultaneously too ambiguous and too specific to capture the nuances of much of anything in predictable phrases containing small numbers of words. Predictable phrases, after all, are information-free and useful primarily as structural elements.</p>
<p>Why are people super pissed about the search system? Maybe people don’t want porn on their dash, so they feel the need to look at the porn tag rather than follow. After all, this change to the search system does not affect your dash; it only affects tag searches.</p>
<p>One of the problems I have with tumblr (which might be made more extreme by the tag system) is that it continually devolves into circle jerks of insular ideologically-homogenous communities, who then fracture into even smaller and even more ideologically homogenous communities and fight with each other. You can build up association with a community like this by following people you agree with, then following people they reblog or follow that you agree with, and so on. However, that takes time and effort; you can build up an imaginary fantasy land where you are right and everyone else is wrong by simply looking in some political tag and following everyone who posts something you agree with, then unfollowing them and sending them anonymous death threats as soon as they say anything you disagree with. This clearly happens pretty frequently, and I can say without reservation that I consider it to be the absolute worst thing that goes on here. Because I like to be well-informed, I follow people from the tumblr left, the tumblr right, the tumblr anarchists, the tumblr communists, the tumblr neoconservatives, the tumblr neo-liberals, centrists, discordians, etc. Most everything that anybody says I disagree with, but respectfully reading and analyzing ideas you disagree with is the system by which informed opinions are formed, and the moment you stop doing that, your opinions cease to be informed. I don’t unfollow people because they post things I disagree with. I unfollow them because they are shitting on someone whose posts they disagree with, and because if I spend another moment of my time reading the hysterical back-and-forth between a pair of sixteen year old white upper-middle-class male vegan feminist anarchists about whether or not eating fish is morally wrong I’ll get a fucking ulcer. Tagging doesn’t form the basis of this behavior, but tag searching makes it much easier to build up a community where dissidence is rare enough that these kinds of naiive ideological penis-measuring contests are constant.</p>
<p>This is not to say that tagging is wrong. Tagging, used properly, can be a means of aiding fully automated systems in fuzzy word categorization (which is pretty important). Tagging also forms the basis of extensions like Tumblr Savior, which (because computers are still worse than even the humans on Tumblr at figuring out whether or not something will be offensive, triggering, or emotionally scarring to random people on the internet) relies upon precisely the things tagging is bad at in order to selectively filter them out and protect emotionally fragile people from information that would cause them anguish. As flippant as my description may be, systems like this not only help prevent physical damage (tagging your gifs will help people with photosensitive epilepsy prevent going into a grand mal seizure whenever they open their dash, and other kinds of tagging can prevent people with various emotional disorders hurting themselves or others because of triggers) but it can also prevent some of the infighting I mentioned above. Filtering out explicitly offensive ideas is different from filtering in only explicitly inoffensive ideas in that community bonds can still form between people whose ideologies are at odds, which encourages dialog later (if my best friend is a supporter of George W. Bush’s policies and never talks about politics, I am more likely to listen and try to understand his perspective when he finally does, and even if he can’t convince me, the perspective I have gained will be useful if I try to tell other people about my own ideas).</p>
<p>Well, what’s a poor boy to do? How does someone use tumblr without using tags?</p>
<p>Obviously, if you are following anybody, they will show up on your dash. Their posts, regardless of whether or not they are tagged, will show up on your dash. They might reblog interesting things from other people, who reblog other interesting things. Follow them. They will show you things that cannot be tagged because they do not yet have names. Those people are probably following even more interesting people, which is useful; some of them probably don’t use any tags at all, or use tags that you have never heard of (even if something has a name, unless you belong to a community that knows its name, the name is a secret to you). Cutting across communities (rather than across minor schisms in tiny micro-specializations of existing interest groups) means absorbing a novel vocabulary and being exposed to things your other friends have never seen; reblog things from the other side, and teach them about mugwumps, orgone accumulators, intersectionality, marxist synthesis, short selling, zugzwang, phosphatidylserine, design fiction, and dutch angles. Most people are interested in more than one thing, and therefore post about more than one thing; if you follow the interesting people and their interesting things, you will find yourself in a strange and wonderful land of brand new ideas. Following organic social structures will not improve your ideological purity: you will probably begin to question the things you started to believe after the last time you began to question your beliefs. That’s probably a good thing, because you will probably never manage to find something to believe that is actually true, and even if you do, you might as well believe some useful and interesting things before then.</p>
