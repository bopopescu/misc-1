<h2>Mercenary culture</h2>
<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://enki2.tumblr.com/post/56454454409/mercenary-culture">enki2</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a spectre haunting modern marketing: the creation of “lifestyle brands&quot;.</p>
<p>A person in advertising, from a memetic perspective, is a kind of mercenary: a non-believer who is paid to cause other non-believers to become believers (with the belief, in this context, being any memeplex that causes the parent company to make money). The most profitable way of doing this is to create the symbol and then endevour to use it to create the signified: produce a visual language of branding, and then associate it (more or less arbitrarily) with idealized consumer traits, after which you hope that enough confused, insecure teenagers will adopt the traits and associate them with the branding that they will lock themselves into a relationship with the parent company that will continue regardless of how abusive it becomes. It’s very profitable because it creates lifetime customers out of a little bit of graphic design and a little bit of callously cynical posturing. This is the “lifestyle brand&quot;.</p>
<p>The routine is most easily observed in the cases where there have been repeated perceived failures, and where we see the same brand reinvented a number of times. Mountain Dew gets its name from a slang for moonshine, and for a long time it was only available in the southeastern united states; the recent can design for the “throwback&quot; campaign indicates that it was intended to market to people who self-identified as “hicks&quot; (and arguably the entire “throwback&quot; campaign was aimed at hipsters). More recently, it strongly identified itself first with professional athletics of varieties pioneered by Gen-Xers (snowboarding, skateboarding, other “extreme&quot; sports); it dropped that campaign a few years later and instead tied itself to triple-A video game franchises, advertising Halo and World of Warcraft on its bottles. While members of each of these audiences may *like* Mountain Dew (after all, fizzy caffeinated sugar-water is pretty hard to go wrong with), there’s no inherent property of Mountain Dew that makes these groups more prone to liking it, nor does Mountain Dew have any inherent property that makes it significantly preferable to these groups than some similar drink like Mello Yello. It’s notable, however, that some of the moves seem to be following on the coat tails of Red Bull, whose campaign was similar (and who is now putting lots of money into the nascent maker movement). Red Bull is more interesting because consuming it prior to competing would probably be actively harmful to athletes (although it’s a good fit for video gamers).</p>
<p>There are some far more successful examples, and through their success they are a bit more subtle. Monster markets hard to a mostly teenage audience that in my day would have been hard-core fans of Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, but now probably listen to similar groups that I’ve never heard of; there’s certainly no association between green, viscous, sugary soft drinks with high caffeine content and white people rapping about their mothers taking away their X-Boxes, but it seems like the association was based off the color scheme of the original can, and the company jumped on merchandising for this audience pretty quickly. This has been their main thrust for a while, although they have sent tentacles into some other subcultures to test the waters (there were some motorsport-related promotions — NASCAR mostly — and one particular flavor that seemed to be targeting military fanboys — a cranberry-based flavour with the famous “pixel vomit&quot; camoflage pattern all over the can — that must have been somewhat successful, seeing as how it’s still carried some places). When people wear Monster logos on their t-shirts and hats, though, they begin to distinguish themselves from the larger invaded subculture (as the use of symbols often does). The merchandising has created its own sub-sub-culture, and all of the money from perpetuating that subculture goes into the same company. I would not be surprised if Monster makes more money off overpriced base ball caps than it does off some particular flavors of its drink.</p>
<p>Apple is another example. Steve Jobs began pushing for a unified aesthetic early, and took semiotics heavily from 1960s modernist ideas about architecture and typography. However, this is one of the few cases where we know, as a matter of public record, the name and content of the design language (the “snow white design language&quot;, which consists of “white and grey, rounded rectangles, and thin horozontal lines&quot;) that has been in use for more than twenty five years. The Snow White design language was used on the original Macintosh, and continues to be used on the hardware of new products, although the aesthetics of the software are in flux. The snow white design language borrows from the minimalist and modernist aesthetics seen in the original Star Trek, and to many people (including the people involved in creating films like Minority Report, The Matrix trilogy, the Men in Black sequels, and other less notable films with prominent use of sparse monochromatic black-on-white interfaces) codes as “the future&quot;, despite being in essence a set of design principles fixed in the public imagination in 1961. However, because of Jobs’ other notable political and personal quirks (many of which also stem from either the 1960s worship of pseudo-orientalism or from the reign of charismatic dictatorial architects and designers of 1950s minimalism), the snow white design language also codes for: wealthy, young, left-leaning, ‘artistic’, arrogant, slightly daft. While having a white box with rounded corners does not inherently associate with any of these things (nor does having a slightly-underpowered version of a PC where the mouse has only one button and all application-specific menus are unified into a single menu bar), the audience self-selects, and it is now an amusing game to pick macintosh fans out from a crowd based on dress or conversational topic. There is truth to the stereotype of the iPhone-slinging barista who wants to save the rainforest by writing self-indulgent poetry during her cigarette breaks, but only because that is a narrative in part created by Apple that people have written themselves into as part and parcel of buying an Apple product.</p>
<p>There are other, twistier angles to this. I’m going to focus now on the commercialization of geekdom. (I want to note that I consider the commercialization of geekdom to be real and problematic, but I do not consider it to have a clear gender component. This is tumblr, and people here are rightfully concerned about gender equality, but the myth of the “fake geek girl&quot; differs fundamentally from the reality of the “manufactured geek&quot;, who can be of any gender. Certainly, the commercialization of geekdom has made the symbols of geekdom more accessible and removed the social stigma to the point that formerly closeted female geeks could come out, and I do not consider that to be a problem, nor do I consider it to be un-genuine. In fact, I’d rather not talk about genuine-ness at all.)</p>
<p>The commercialization of geekdom is particularly interesting in terms of lifestyle branding because it’s a purely referential system. Geekdom, in part, is a culture of exclusion by way of shibboleth, wherein its primary social currency is obsession. It does not differ fundamentally from indie hipsterism, except insomuch as the pieces of geek culture that form major schisms are not obscure by being unobtainable or artificially scarce but instead are obscure by virtue of taking up lots of time and attention (for instance, watching all of Mobile Suite Gundam and its spin-offs, or learning to speak fluent Klingon). When outside commercial interests exploit a system of references, they exploit it without regard to the referent, which gives us media like The Big Bang Theory (wherein the joke is that the characters are playing D&amp;D, or attending a showing of Planet of the Apes — a reference to an existing piece of media with cultural background, but a shallow one wherein understanding the context provides no benefit to the viewer). When this kind of thing is profitable (and, with an exclusionary culture based on shibboleths, shallowness is no barrier to profitability since a priori most of any mixed audience will get only some of the references of a purely referential piece of media), the signifiers themselves become symbols of this fracture-group purgatory of newcomers and poseurs. The symbols of the symbols become more profitable by far than the signified.</p>
<p>It is into this context that we bring the Cthulu plushies. The original text, Call of Cthulu, does not create a market for Cthulu plushies. It’s a short story, damn near a hundred years old and never very profitable for the author, in which the creature appears in the last few pages, lumbers around, gets whacked with a piece of wood, and then disappears into the sea. The creature is not particularly clearly described: he has a bulbous head, wings, a mane of tentacles, lion-like aft-limbs that extend forward too far and forepaws that sit on top of the back paws with claws that extend out and dig into the flesh. Nothing this creature does is particularly scary; the fear in the story comes from the idea (pretty novel in the 1920s) that a real god as described by worshippers could be much more frightening than a purely mechanistic universe, and that furthermore, a being fitting the description of a god living within a purely mechanistic universe would be by necessity alien enough to make the extent of the universe itself frightening. The first line of the story provides us with its theme (the theme, indeed, of cosmic horror in general), and the theme is not that fish are frightening, or that there is a green monster under the sea with a squid for a head. Readers of Lovecraft have no reason to desire a Cthulu plushie, and were they to obtain merchandise, it might actually be both more representative and more economical to invest in a large quantity of dried starfish. Cthulu plushies (and this is the key) are a symbol used by people who have not read Lovecraft to communicate with other people who also have not read Lovecraft that they are associated with the general group of people who make Lovecraft references without having read Lovecraft — which is as legitimate a group as any, but has little at all to do with Lovecraft; similar groups can and do appear surrounding Pynchon, Eco, Gibson, Joyce, and Burroughs (both Edgar Rice and William S). Other media (affectionate parodies and the like, some quite good) also cater partially or primarily to this space: Neil Gaiman’s A Study in Emerald, Charles Stross’s Laundry series, Steve Jackson Games’ Call of Cthulu. Some of these media are essentially acceptable to people who appreciate original Lovecraft, and here the intersection becomes a problem: when displaying an appreciation for Lovecraft can be read as (paradoxically) not having been exposed to any Lovecraft except indirectly (and furthermore being part of a community manufactured by the callously cynical marketroids in the themed plushie industry) and displaying an appreciation for some legitimately enjoyable third party media (say, A Study in Emerald) causes the likelihood of a clued-in stranger to assume that you are part of the market-driven group rather than the content-driven group to jump from 0.5 to 0.75, do you then admit that you enjoy the related media and explain at great length that you are truly a fan, or do you hide your enjoyment of the related media and expose it only to trusted friends?</p>
<p>Yet another interesting twist is possible. Right now, Thinkgeek is selling Jayne hats. People on Etsy, at the same time, are being sued for selling Jayne hats. For those not clued in, a Jayne hat is not merely a crappy-looking wool hat that some people wear at conventions or post pictures of themselves wearing on facebook. Actually, it is a crappy-looking wool hat that appeared in an episode that was never aired of a show that was canceled a decade ago. Firefly fandom has jumped on the Jayne hat as a symbol of itself, but a viewer of Firefly would never actually see the hat unless they bought the DVDs. In other words, the Jayne hat is a symbol of a symbol of a symbol *without a signified*. This is a bit like the Evangelion fan community taking walking a cat as a symbol of Evangelion fandom, because Kaworu was originally supposed to be introduced walking a cat on a leash, as shown by some leaked promotional material given by Gainax to potential sponsors some years before the show was aired. While it is true that to follow that chain of references takes dedication, it is entirely unnecessary: I can learn that walking a cat is code for being an Evangelion fan, and then walk a cat at Nekocon without having seen Evangelion, secure in the knowledge that everyone who sees me will assume that I’m some kind of guru of Evangelion trivia. The tantalizing promise of exchanging some money for a spot in the community is such that Jayne hats are potentially more profitable than Firefly was in the first place, since watching Firefly takes several hours of uninterrupted time and wearing a hat takes a couple dollars.</p>
<p>Now, it’s true that there is a utility to the use of social symbols, lossy as it may be. If I meet someone at a convention and they are dressed as a troll, I can assume that they are from the Homestuck fandom, and I can probably talk to them about that (or ask them where I can buy overpriced colored horns and/or zodiac symbols). If I see someone wearing extremely baggy pants, brand new Nike sneakers, and a faded baseball cap with dollar signs and diamonds on it, I will be more likely to ask them about the location of the Eminem concert than the Journey concert. To the extent that you can afford to (to the extent that you can purchase these symbols, and to the extent that you can use them in public without major social stigma), you choose how to portray yourself, so your use of symbols is essentially your own responsibility. In a world free of the meaningful use of social signifiers, I would be much less efficient: I would need to be far more exhaustive in my search for particular information, because I could not target people likely to know it based on arbitrarily clustered affinities. However, when the clustering of affinities is engineered for the purpose of enriching a few large corporations, it’s a mistake to pretend there isn’t a set of ulterior motives hiding behind those choices, and it’s worthwhile to consider what you are buying into before you identify with something.</p>
<p>Apple products have been coded to mean sensitive to social justice issues, but Apple itself is guilty of human rights violations. Apple has been coded to mean wealthy, but as conspicuous consumption, Apple products are fragile and prone to failure in addition to heavy lock-in, so an investment in Apple products as an indication of aspiration toward wealth is more likely to lead to a cycle of crippling debt than a less expensive and more open competitor.</p>
<p>Cthulu plushies have been coded in the mainstream to mean ‘geeky’, but are coded within the group of people who read Lovecraft to mean ‘poseur’; even if you genuinely like the product, do you want the stigma of (falsely) being considered a poseur? Furthermore, do you want to push money into a franchise that sells a false sense of belonging?</p>
<p>Monster’s branding may fit you perfectly right now, but as soon as their marketing department decides that your group is no longer profitable, they will drop the line and instead start selling basketball jerseys or re-branded matchbox cars. Do you want to demonstrate your loyalty to a company that has no loyalty to you? Furthermore, do you want to advertise to your peer group that you wholeheartedly support socially manipulative marketing tactics?</p>
<p>‘Mercenary’ is sometimes used as a slur. After all, it’s at its core the opposite of loyalty. I don’t consider loyalty to be a virtue in of itself, but at the same time, it is probably a mistake to build your identity out of dreams of loyalty invented by mercenaries.</p>
