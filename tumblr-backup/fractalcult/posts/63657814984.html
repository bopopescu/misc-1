<h5 class="uiStreamMessage userContentWrapper" data-ft='{"type":1,"tn":"K"}'><span class="messageBody" data-ft='{"type":3,"tn":"K"}'><span class="userContent">I am reading a wonderful book by Gould about the Structure of Evolutionary Theory. While the focus is on genetic evolution, I feel much of it can be applied in Sociocultural domains too.<br/><br/> The diagram here depicts how, for any given evolved trait process - we must consider three possible poles of explanation: I) Functional - that is, the trait is a Adaptation to current surroundings, II) Formal - the trait is due to Constraints of Structure. III) History - the trait is explained by Historical Contingency.<br/><br/> Mostly - things are some combination of all three. For example - if we ask, why is the space bar on the keyboard so wide and particularly placed? Clearly its Functionally adapted to be hit by thumbs since its often used. But why are all the letters on the keyboard placed where they are? The answer is Historical and Formal - back when typewriters were used there was a Formal restriction preventing frequently used key combinations from being placed close to one another because of jamming. But as this Formal restriction disappeared, people were used to the old configuration, so it remained.<br/><br/> - Ix<br/></span></span></h5>
