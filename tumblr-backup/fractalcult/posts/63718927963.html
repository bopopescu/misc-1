<h5 class="uiStreamMessage userContentWrapper" data-ft='{"type":1,"tn":"K"}'><span class="messageBody" data-ft='{"type":3,"tn":"K"}'><span class="userContent">I have begun attending meditation class, and one of the things I learned from the last class was the following:<br/><br/> I have been aware for a few years now that desires can be frustrating when we can&rsquo;t sate them, and that we need to be able to let go of them when they are interfering with our lives (cf. Buddha). But what I was not aware of, is how often I do something because I subconsciously am trying to satisfy a desire, which I might be aware of in one context, but not in another (framing bias!). The problem here is you might be trying to achieve your goal in a wholly retarded way, but are simply not aware of it.<br/><br/> Hence my new mantra: WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?</span></span></h5>
