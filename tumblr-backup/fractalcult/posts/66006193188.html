<h2>So what do we mean by chaos anyway? </h2>
<p dir="ltr">A gospel from Saint Amir.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Obviously, when we talk about chaos,  we don’t mean the destructive, lawless state most people think of when you say chaos. That state of being is not chaos. It is defined by human decisions and expectations and actions. That state is the prophecy of bureaucrats and aristocrats afraid of losing what they have. <br/>
But this isn’t about them, or their prophecies. <br/>
This is about chaos. <br/>
Chaos gets compared to a physical condition called entropy often. Entropy is the tendency of the natural world to prefer simpler systems. Full disclosure, that&rsquo;s a gross oversimplification, but it works for the purpose of this thought process. <br/>
So entropy is usually portrayed as a force of decay, of destruction. This is not the case. It has more to do with the spread of energy over an area, the preference to avoid peaks and valleys: local minima and maxima. It seeks equilibrium with the universe, to wax poetic. <br/>
This is not chaos.<br/>
Chaos, the way we talk about, it resembles potential energy more than entropy. It can take the form of havoc or decay, or it can be a thing of creation. It is not a thing. It is the potential for many things. <br/>
But even then potential energy is a symbol for chaos, a representation and nothing more. Just as the word is not the thing, just as the equation is not the electron, the perceived world is not the chaos. <br/>
In short, chaos is the reality, and all else is an imperfect symbol. And yet chaos is only a symbol for reality. (Waxing Platonic up in this piece)<br/>
So learn what you can from the chaos and the symbols and the reality, and don&rsquo;t worry too much about the rest. <br/>
And I promise one of these days I will stop blowing smoke up your ass. </p>
