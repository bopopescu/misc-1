<h2>The Mysterious Spirit of the Valley (ERIS)</h2>
<p>In the Tao Te Ching, <a href="http://www.wussu.com/laotzu/laotzu06.html">chapter 6</a> is about the &ldquo;mysterious valley goddess&rdquo; who is the source of all things.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The valley spirit never dies;<br/> It is the woman, primal mother.<br/> Her gateway is the root of heaven and earth.<br/> It is like a veil barely seen.<br/> Use it; it will never fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always wondered, why is the mysterious feminine a &ldquo;valley goddess&rdquo;? Are we, like, talking about, like, California girls? Is it just because the valley is a natural image?<br/><br/>I recently came across a <a href="http://taotechingdecoded.com/TbM/0600.htm">strange translation</a> which describes the &ldquo;valley&rdquo; as empty space. <em>&ldquo;All space is as empty as a valley.&rdquo;</em> That sounds very close to the <a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/51.php">Principia Discordia&rsquo;s take on Primal Chaos</a>, the formless void from whence all things arise. Chaos is the state of an idea before it&rsquo;s happened, before it&rsquo;s been pinned down and formed by thought and brought into the world.<br/><br/>So the Valley goddess is really like the goddess of potential energy, the ideas that can arise from the space between ideas.<br/><br/>This particular translation suggests that the emptiness is like a screen that we project a hologram (the world) onto. This pair (what exists, and what does not exist) are complimentary opposites.<br/><br/>If we take the mysterious figure in this passage to be Eris, it shows us that she is not a Goddess of the material world, or forms, of existence&hellip; rather, she&rsquo;s the personification of what could be, what the world could become. She&rsquo;s the space in which we have our good ideas. She&rsquo;s the valley between the mountains of our lives into which we project our future.</p>
