<h2>On Duality and Gender</h2>
<p>as a little tangent &ndash; sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to reconcile modern progressive gender roles, etc, and these <a href="http://www.wussu.com/laotzu/laotzu06.html">ancient passages</a> which talk about the natural harmonious symmetry between male and female. It makes you wonder, were the ancients huge homophobes? Well they probably were but that&rsquo;s not what they were writing about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the real message here is anything about sexuality or anything. I take it just to talk about generic harmonious opposites. It&rsquo;s not saying men are naturally active and women are naturally passive or anything like that. I think it just means that the creative forces of the universe come from the gaps and cracks and, you know, vaginas &ndash; of what has already been created.</p>
<p>In that way, <em>what exists</em> and<em> what does not</em> are harmonious opposites. Their metaphorical genitals are irrelevant, they could both be butch lesbians for all we know, that&rsquo;s not really the point. The point is that they have wild freaky sex all day erry day.</p>
