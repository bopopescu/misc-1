<p>&ldquo;The Daoists of ancient China developed some sophisticated Internal Alchemy to describe cycles of experience in terms of <em>Yin</em> (which I will will here take to correspond to <em>Disorder</em>) and <em>Yang</em> (which we will interpret as <em>Order</em>). We can map the seasons of chaos to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing"><em>Wu Xing</em></a> - quoting the wikipedia article - are &quot;also known as the <strong>Five Elements</strong>, <strong>Five Phases</strong>, the <strong>Five Agents</strong>, the <strong>Five Movements</strong>, <strong>Five Processes</strong>, and the <strong>Five Steps/Stages</strong>&rdquo;. Considering the erudition and ingenuity of Greg Hill and Kerry Thornley, I find it hard to dismiss offhand that this might have been intentional:<br/><br/>Earth = Yin/Yang Balance -&gt;&lt;- Disorder/Order Balance = Chaos</p>
<p>Metal = Rising Yin            -&gt;&lt;-            Rising Disorder = Discord<br/><br/>Water = Full Yin               -&gt;&lt;-                Full Disorder = Confusion</p>
<p>Wood = Rising Yang         -&gt;&lt;-                Rising Order = Bureaucracy<br/><br/>Fire    = Full Yang             -&gt;&lt;-                   Full Order =  Aftermath<br/><br/>Discordians often observe how the sequence of these are not always consistent with the traditional cycle outlined in the Principia Discordia. The Chinese developed several cycles using this system, and I illustrate by overlaying the seasons on the diagram from Wikipedia:<br/><br/><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_mwvua4xQeF1rysh7z.png"/>The Daoist Elemental Model is consisting of several cycles or relationships mapping the elements:</p>
<ol><li>Creating cycle: <strong>生; shēng</strong> - One element promotes / supports the next  (Parent begets Child).</li>
<li>Destroying cycle: <strong>剋</strong>;<strong> kè</strong> - One element controls / regulates the next (Grandparent controls Child).</li>
<li>Overacting cycle: <strong>cheng</strong> - One element overwhelmed / overacts on the child (Parent overwhelms Child)</li>
<li>Insulting cycle: <strong>侮;</strong> <strong>wǔ</strong> (Reverse Ke) - One element insults / weakens the next (Grandchild insults Grandparent).</li>
</ol><p>It seems like Creating and Destroying cycles are balancing or stabilizing forces (Anerisian?) and the the Overacting and Insulting cycles are unbalancing (Erisian?). The Creation and The Overacting cycle may be conceived as the Anerisian and Erisian aspects of the conventional cycle of the seasons. The Destroying and Insulting cycles are the Anerisian and Erisian regulatory counter cycles that balance them.<br/><br/>I am not entirely convinced any of this makes any sense, and more research needs to be done to corroborate or dismiss this. I thought it might regardless be an interesting starting point to play around with Discordian Alchemy.</p>
