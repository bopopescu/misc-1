<p><em>  -Principia Discordia</em></p>
<p><em>-&gt;&lt;-</em></p>
<p>In Chuang Tzu there appears in the 11th chapter appears a character called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Meng" title="Hung-Meng">Hung Meng</a> . Wikipedia notes it<em> &ldquo;compounds hong </em><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%B4%BB" title="wikt:鴻">鴻</a><em> &quot;wild goose, swan; vast, great&rdquo; and meng </em><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%92%99" title="wikt:蒙">蒙</a><em> &ldquo;covered; ignorant (esp. in childhood), untutored; encounter, receive; (<a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yijing" title="Yijing">Yijing</a>) <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_hexagram_04#Hexagram_4" title="I Ching hexagram 04">Hexagram 4</a>&rdquo;.

<p>The Sam Hamil and Jerome P. Seaton translation of selected chapters - the Essential Chuang Tzu - does an excellent job at relaying the absurdity of this tale:</p>
<p>-&gt;&lt;-</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-689fa9cf-0838-2dfc-5e43-32d00cfdb177"><span>CLOUD GENERAL WANDERED EASTERLY. EMERGING FROM under the Fu-yao tree&rsquo;s branches, he bumped into Big Goose Dummy. Drumming on his tummy, Big Goose Dummy was about to take off like a hopping sparrow. When Cloud General saw him, he hesitated, then stopped, amazed. &quot;Say, Old One,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;who are you and what are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Big Goose Dummy kept drumming on his tummy, flapping and hopping like a sparrow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rambling.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I have something to ask about,&rdquo; Cloud General said.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The ch'i of heaven is out of harmony,&rdquo; Cloud General said, &ldquo;and the ch'i of earth is gnarly and knotted. The Six Ch'i are out of tune, the Four Seasons out of order. Now I want to harmonize the essence of the Six Ch'i for the benefit of all living things. How am I to undertake such a task?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Still drumming his tummy and scratching his head and sparrow-hopping about, Big Goose Dummy muttered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>So Cloud General didn&rsquo;t get his answer.</span></p>
<p><span>Three years later, however, when he was wandering east in the wilds where people are even dumber than in Sung, he ran into Big Goose Dummy again. Cloud General was happy, and ran up, shouting, &ldquo;Oh, Heaven! Have you forgotten me?&rdquo; He bowed his head to the ground and begged for another audience.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I wander and ramble without knowing what I seek,&rdquo; Big Goose Dummy said. &ldquo;A madman, a king dog, I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going. The wanderer, unhaltered, is not deceived by what is seen. What more do you want?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite a mad-dog king myself,&rdquo; Cloud General said. &ldquo;But the people all follow my trail. I can&rsquo;t get what I want for them, and it is for their sake that I now beg you to speak a single word.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;What throws the warp of heaven into chaos, what rebels against the facts of things?&rdquo; Big Goose Dummy replied. &ldquo;What can keep mysterious heaven from accomplishing its ends? What scatters herds of beasts, makes birds cry in the night, and brings bad luck to bugs? I have the idea that it&rsquo;s excess ruling hu-mankind!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;What can I do about that?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Big Goose Dummy said, &ldquo;I have an idea: poison. Or take off and fly home.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Meeting with you,&rdquo; Cloud General said, &ldquo;is difficult. Let me hear just one word.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;My idea?&rdquo; Big Goose Dummy said. &ldquo;Nourish your heart and mind. Stay put and do nothing. Things will change on their own. 1 )rop your form and your body. Drop seeing and hearing. Forget connections. Forget things. Find the Great Unity in the watery vastness. Cut loose from heart and mind. Let go of the spirit. Go forth soulless as a desert. The ten thousand things all return to their roots. They return to their roots without knowing. Get into the pure mud of the Muddle Puddle. Run out your string right there. Never leave. If you&rsquo;re knowing it, you&rsquo;re leaving it. Without asking its name or taking a peek at the facts, things have come down solid from ancient times, all on their own.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Heaven has handed down to me the Power of Virtue,&rdquo; Cloud General said, &ldquo;and shown me in dark silence the black dog of mystery. All my life, I&rsquo;ve bent and bowed my body in the hunt for it. Now I&rsquo;ve captured it.&rdquo; He bowed once more, politely took his leave, and departed.</span></p>
