<h2>~On Projection and the Corrective Hyperbole in Discourse~</h2>
<p>On occasion I catch myself in discourse projecting a misconception on the other person based on very little information. Most frequently I seem to do this with misconceptions which repeatedly revealed themselves in conversations I have had - whether I made them or another. Ironically I seem most frustrated when a person is repeating an error I have frequently made in the past. I suspect I am not the only one.<br/><br/>There are topics of exceeding subtlety which demand frequent course corrections; the balance between the Anerisian and Erisian; between Rationalism and Skepticism, between Dualistic Distinction and Non-Dualistic Intuition, between Realism and Surrealism or between Humor and Seriousness. In such fine and nuanced lines, I have found myself - in seeming hypocrisy - pushing in one direction or the other depending on the context.<br/><br/>Hyperbole is the the direction opposite of the bias is a frequent teaching tool in Asian religious traditions; so the Buddha emphasized suffering in the world only to correct the imbalanced view that it is all about pleasure; so the Daoists emphasize ineffability,  unknowability and inaction only to correct for the over emphasis of the converse by other schools. <br/><br/>Principia Discordia seems to have taken up this tool, indeed the very spirit of it almost based on it, and so brilliantly created a movement to help correct an imbalance in Western thinking. Many have oft pointed out that many Spags take this too far, and correctly respond by pushing the other way. This kind of situation can and does explode into the verbal equivalent of a WWF wrestling match. We might do well to consider we are sometimes project exaggeration or misconception on others, and perhaps try and nuance the hyperbole to the circumstances&hellip;..<br/><br/>&hellip;.especially when we talk with Discordians.</p>
