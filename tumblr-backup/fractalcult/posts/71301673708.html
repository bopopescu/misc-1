<h2>~ Exploring beyond Maps ~ Part I</h2>
<p>A more <span>skeptical</span> leaning with regard to model realism has long been part of Discordian Mythos, and indeed we all hear the old anecdote about <em>Maps</em> and <em>Territories</em> gets thrown around a lot (as it should be). Robert Anton Wilson – who called himself an Agnostic Mystic – probably did a great deal to promote this perspective, for example in this famous segment from Prometheus Rising:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All experience is a muddle, until we make a model to explain it. The model can clarify the muddles, but the model is never the muddle itself. “The map is not the territory”; the menu does not taste like the meal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implicitly, the metaphor of a Map elicits the idea of <em>correspondence</em>; <strong>the symbols on the Map are intended to correspond to objects in the Territory.</strong> This fits in with the correspondence theory of truth; a <em>descriptive</em> conception of models as representations of reality. Indeed – even <em>explanatory</em> value can be conceived as a type of causal description. I would guess the majority of scientific work is orientated around this Map conception.</p>
<p>This is all good and well, and this idea of the Map (the descriptive model) is very powerful and useful for navigating and clarifying the Territory.<strong> However I would doubt a person&rsquo;s exploration skills if they spend more time staring at a Map than at the Territory.</strong> Nor do we as inhabitants of the Territory spend all our time navigating - we live here, work here, and play here - we use more Tools than just Maps.</p>
<p>What if some ideas are more like a <em>Compass</em> – for example the contrast between Erisian and Anerisian – are there for giving a rough orientation in the Territory? Or perhaps others still function as a<em> Torch</em>, illuminating (inner or outer) darkness in the territory (think of how the law of fives helps reveal our confirmation bias). Other might be <em>MetaTools</em> – such as the<em> Analytical Knife</em> that dissects Maps, or the <em>Synthetic Duck Tape</em> for binding them together. The list goes on&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The treatment of ideas as Tools is nothing new; in the American Pragmatic tradition a position known as<em> Instrumentalism</em> sought to treat scientific theory as a tool for prediction, and our kindred<em> Chaos Magic</em> tradition takes a similar attitude to beliefs. In my opinion this is a powerful way to treat thoughts and models, although certainly not the only valid way. However – if we are to take this attitude –<strong> I would suggest we explore beyond Maps.</strong></p>
