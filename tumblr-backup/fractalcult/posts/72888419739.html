<h2>Lost Potential and Solipsisim</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about not living up to your full potential. This life you&rsquo;re living, and the probability expression you&rsquo;re living it in, it may not be the &ldquo;best,&rdquo; for whatever arbitrary values to which you assign preference.</p>
<p>But this life will be the longest of any expression of your lives.</p>
<p>Let me step back. In order for me to continue, I need to make sure we&rsquo;re speaking the same language. I need to make sure you understand a little bit about multiverse theory and chaos theory. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of those terms; you&rsquo;re probably familiar with the ideas those terms describe, I&rsquo;m just putting a name on them so it&rsquo;s easier to tell you what I mean.</p>
<p>Multiverse theory is the theory that there are multiple versions of the universe as we know it, or don&rsquo;t know it. Whichever. Anyway, so one approach to multiverse theory which probably has its own special name is this: Every outcome for an event has happened in some parallel universe.</p>
<p>Say you&rsquo;ve walked up to a crossroads (and who doesn&rsquo;t love one of those, am I right?) You can go forward, left, right, back where you came from. You can also ditch the roads and gallivant off through the fields if you like, but let&rsquo;s color inside the lines for a bit, my clever readers. You have four options, so suddenly there are four versions of the universe where you came to that crossroads at that time. <br/>Repeat that every time you or any other person or animal or plant or what have you makes a decision. Try to figure out how many universes are created in a single second, and you&rsquo;ll find your head sore and your computer demonstrating why the ancient Chinese just stopped at 10,000 and called that &ldquo;as many as we&rsquo;ll ever need to think about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, basic chaos theory. Everything affects everything else. A butterfly flaps its wings in Wellington and causes a hurricane in Haiti, that&rsquo;s the classic explanation. If you&rsquo;re really determined to trace what caused what caused what back as far as you can, you&rsquo;ll find things get silly very quickly. Usually, you just trace to a useful origin point If you&rsquo;re a lawyer, you only trace back to something you can prosecute, for example. If you&rsquo;re a priest, you trace things back as far as you can be bothered, then proclaim &ldquo;God wills it&rdquo; and bump off for a pint. Similarly, if you&rsquo;re a scientist, you trace things back as far as you can be bothered, then realize you&rsquo;re not getting any work done on your real research and bump off for a pint. Try hard enough, and you can trace everything back to the scatter of particles from the big bang.<br/>Don&rsquo;t try that hard, though; proving that one is a pain and not worth the effort. Besides, we might figure out what went on before the big bang, and then you have to find a new absolute origin point.</p>
<p>For this sermon, let&rsquo;s use your birth as our origin point. That&rsquo;s where you begin, after all, and that event only happened exactly as it did in one universe. From there, your life sprawls out as a series of occurrences in you and the world around you. Chaos theory makes every multiverse with you in it unique, perhaps in little ways, perhaps in large ways. <br/>Whichever ways happen, a bunch of versions of you are gonna die, more every second. Eventually, there are no more versions of you under the age of six months; they either kept living or died. So it goes, on and on, until only one of you is still alive. That&rsquo;s the you that you&rsquo;re perceiving.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s no way to explain this next bit that isn&rsquo;t out there, so bear with me. You know the whole Schrodinger&rsquo;s Box experiment, where the cat is both alive and dead until you open the box and see which? Yeah, you&rsquo;re the cat. And you find out whether you&rsquo;re alive or dead every time one of you dies.<br/>If a version of you has died, it&rsquo;s not the you that you perceive being. It can&rsquo;t be; you can&rsquo;t perceive being dead. So as long as there&rsquo;s another you left, you&rsquo;re still alive. Since I assume you can&rsquo;t perceive multiple versions of your life (And if you can, message me; I&rsquo;d love to hear what it feels like), you&rsquo;re not any of the yous that dies while there&rsquo;s another you alive. You&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s going to live the longest of any you. It&rsquo;s not a perfect analogue, but it&rsquo;s like what physicists call &ldquo;collapsing the wave function.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why does anyone die young?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re probably not perceiving anyone you know in the life where they live the longest. It&rsquo;s not impossible, just really, really unlikely. You&rsquo;re only living in and perceiving one of near-infinite universes where you exist, and so is everyone else. Maybe Kurt Cobain will have perceived living to 90. I perceive he died at 27; that doesn&rsquo;t mean he perceived dying at 27. The inverse is also true; most people you know aren&rsquo;t going to perceive you as you perceive yourself. The versions of them in your longest life may be totally different from them as they perceive themselves.</p>
<p>In short, don&rsquo;t get caught up worrying over how little time you have and how much of it you&rsquo;re wasting not realizing your potential. You have all the time you could possibly have; it&rsquo;s up to you to decide what to do with it. I recommend grabbing a hot dog; it&rsquo;s Friday where I am, after all.</p>
<p>Much love from your buddy,<br/>Saint Amir Zetathustra, Heretic</p>
