<h2>Of Straw Men and Iron Maidens</h2>
<p>In debating issues close to our hearts, its difficult to avoid projecting caricatured views upon our opponents. <em>Cramulus</em> caught me red handed doing this to one of his posts; in a state of ideological paranoia I projected upon his words a particular fallacy that frequently irks me. Indeed I often have an axe to grind. In debate, the common temptation is to make <em>Straw Men</em> out of our opponents&rsquo; positions. It seems there are countless creative ways of doing this.<br/><br/>I have been trying (with varying degrees of success) to implement a heuristic and projection that is the <em>opposite</em> of the <em>Straw Man</em> - something I call an <em>Iron Maiden</em>. The Iron Maiden is what you perceive to be the strongest possible formulation of the opponent&rsquo;s position. You trap yourself in the Iron Maiden, and demonstrate you can escape its clutches, thus attempting to refute the strongest possible objection to your proposition. Great scholars seem to do this often.<br/><br/>Your proposition will not always escape unscathed. You will see the strengths of the opposing view, and the weaknesses of your own. The goal is to get the best of both worlds, and improve both positions as a result. Or maybe a new position will be formulated that is better than both. I often like to say that <em>bridges are build from both ends</em>.<br/><br/>I feel that for full effect the Iron Maiden must also be applied to the very value of different argumentation methods. Different traditions and cultures have different methods of argumentation, logics and values. For the sake of applying the Iron Maiden heuristic we may have to change our very values; to give increased weight to an argument or method we normally might take lightly.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend">Paul Feyerabend</a> made an interesting distinction; he called a <em>Guided Exchange</em> a debate where one doctrine is presumed superior and if a participant does not abide by <em>the</em> Rules them they are derided as &lsquo;Irrational&rsquo; (or whatever that doctrine calls its heretics). In contrast, an <em>Open Exchange </em>isa discussion where the rules and methods of the discussion are <em>not</em> fixed but <em>evolve</em> as participants immerse in each others worldviews and traditions. It seems to me that the Iron Maiden complements the Open Exchange nicely, and that both would help foster an atmosphere of mutual respect in discourse, one where we<em> assume intelligence instead of stupidity in our fellow human beings</em>.</p>
