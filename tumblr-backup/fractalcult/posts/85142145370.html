<h2>Discordianism 2014</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Discordianism has a lot of layers. The surface layer is often called the Legion of Dynamic Discord. A common LDD interpretation of Discordianism is that it is mainly about causing disorder and fucking with people. That’s why LDD also stands for “Little Deluded Dupes” - they got reeled in by the Eristic Delusion.<br/><br/>The LDD mainly consists of aimless kids who are driven by their pleasure drive. And it’s pretty much like 4chan. They have trouble distinguishing between Grayface and people who merely disagree with them. They do a lot of trolling people for lulz and trying to ruin people’s day. Being “edgy”. You know, like those stickers where Calvin is taking a piss?<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, that’s always been the case. Legend has it, Lord Omar / Kerry Thornley logged onto alt.discordia only once, and then was immediately disappointed by the surface level dickery. A lot of those cats thought their mild rebelliousness was actually subversive. A whole box of tools at their disposal and they were only using one.<br/><br/>A lot of the people get stuck there in the LDD, that’s their destination. For others, it’s just a phase they pass through on the journey towards Aftermath. Everybody’s gotta start somewhere.<br/><br/>The spirit of Discordia contains a recipe for building a better world. A big part of that creation involves dismantling the world that exists right now, the Machine. We hold up a mirror that reflects the Machine’s absurdity back at itself. It’s not easy. It’s actually a pretty difficult trick to pull off. At the most basic level, it involves resistance against the everyday “consensus trance”. What to do after that is hotly debated.<br/><br/>So we spread out and study the works of Leary, RAW, the Situationist International, Mandelbrot, Taleb, Banksy, Pussy Riot, Foucault, Baurdillard, Joey Skaggs, John Cage, the list goes on and on … So many people have discovered methods of dismantlement.<br/><br/>Next, we’ve gotta pool all this knowledge, correlate it, sift it out, teach each other how to dismantle The Machine.<br/><br/>The big picture, I think, is not some grand revolution or cultural upheaval. If we all learn how to adjust the parts of the Machine in our immediate vicinity, we can create little islands worth living on. Eventually, the space between those islands will be smaller and smaller, and eventually the edges will bleed into one another until the whole world is transformed because its filled with people who think for themselves.<br/><br/>We can all build our own worlds worth living in - and invite each other over to hang out. And one day (the prophecy goes), the cool parts of the world will have gotten so large that the uncool parts have become little islands ruled by little egos, which don’t bother anybody anymore.</p>
