<h2>Clergy for the Strange</h2>
<p>Discordians are the Clergy for the Strange. This is an important aspect of the Discordian Society which the world really needs right now.<br/><br/>There are a lot of people out there who don&rsquo;t quite fit into this fucked up place. A lot of them are lonely or freaked out because they believe they are alone. Many don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re weird yet, they just have this spiritual discomfort they haven&rsquo;t learned to articulate.<br/><br/>I was privileged to grow up around open-minded free-thinkers, so I had a support network for my own bizarre interests and tastes. But I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s really alienating to be the one blue haired girl in a town full of cabbages. A lot of people have to keep their weirdness a secret, they bury it so deep they forget it&rsquo;s there. It&rsquo;s a terrible shame. Birds of paradise living in little gilded cages.<br/><br/>These people need our help. We&rsquo;ve seen that you don&rsquo;t have to play by the Rules, let&rsquo;s show others that too. When I&rsquo;m putting up weird posters around town, part of my motivation is as a signpost showing *somebody* out there that he&rsquo;s not alone - other people are awake too, and when we all &ldquo;find the others&rdquo;, everything&rsquo;s gonna turn out okay.<br/><br/>First, you&rsquo;ve gotta escape your cell. Then you&rsquo;ve gotta find the keys and pass them around. That is my best guess at how the Discordian Society can work together and accomplish something worth while &hellip; when we see somebody getting ground up by the Machine, we&rsquo;ve gotta toss them a life jacket. <br/><br/>We are the priests and popes and cardinals and kings &ndash; of the strange. Throw open the doors of this church and invite everybody in.</p>
