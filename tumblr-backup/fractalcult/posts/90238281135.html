As a Chaoist as well as a Discordian I tend to place Eris as part of the Chao.</span><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$1:0"/><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$3:0"/><span data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$4:0">But maybe Eris the same thing as the Chao? Principia says she is a goddess of Chaos (as well as Confusion and Discord), and yet the Erisian is only one side of the Chao (which has uncountably many sides of course). One solution to this paradox is to say both are right, and the Chao contains itself; but then the Anerisian would be non-Chao (the Fnord?) which also seems odd. Thus the Chao would be a symbol for the Non-Duality of Duality and Non-Duality, with the Erisian representing Chaoward&rsquo;s and the Anerisian representing Fnordwards manifestations of the Chao. Maybe couldbe possible sensible Sri Syadasti.</span><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$5:0"/><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$7:0"/><span data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$8:0">But <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/whoisbaphomet/" target="_blank">who the Fnord is Baphomet</a>? It seems this is a lost and ancient mystery upon which many speculations have been speckled. It has been attributed as anything from a code representing the Temple of Solomon to the Templars, to Sophia the goddess of Wisdom (Eris?), to the Father of Understanding (Aneris?), to the Unity of All Opposites and Pan the Pangenitor (the Chao?). Perhaps Baphomet is Puck trickster god (from whence the diminutive form Pixie derives). Note that these last, goatlike representation seems to be recent (19th c.). I honestly can&rsquo;t I guess today I will choose to treat Baphomet as Aneris or the Fnord side of the Chao Coin. This master of Illusion so bamboozled various mystics as to gain so many different attributions, it seems appropriate.</span><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$9:0"/><br data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$11:0"/><span data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$text0:0:$12:0">So in the context of this current, arbitrary and moral mythological arrangement, I would answer neither and both. They tend to fuck one day as eternal lovers, and battle the next as arch enemies. Neither would exist without the other!</span><span data-reactid=".b.1:3:1:$comment494611804003253_495342670596833:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$0:0"></span></span></span></p>
