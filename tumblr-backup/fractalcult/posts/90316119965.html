<blockquote>
<p>Meditation is, in part, about leaving your body, leaving the ego, leaving the self, until there’s no you left</p>
<p>To this end, a mantra can be helpful. It doesn’t matter what the mantra consists of. It’s just something for your mind to wrap itself around and spin over and over again until you get lost in it.</p>
<p>OM MANI PADME HUM. Om mani padme hum. OM MANI PADME HUM. Om mani padme hum.</p>
<p>It doesn’t even mean anything! It’s just Holy nonsense. (Fnord) Just say it in a rhythm, over and over again, until you forget about your body. There is no body, there is no you, all that exists is just the sound.</p>
<p>This is how Eris taught me to meditate:</p>
<p>at some point, let your mantra dissolve into this:</p>
<p>OU-WA TAGU SIAM</p>
<p>over and over again</p>
<p>OU-WA TAGU SIAM<br/>OU-WA TAGU SIAM<br/>OU-WA TAGU SIAM</p>
<p>It’s impossible to stop yourself from recognizing what you’re saying. But that’s the goal, to say it until it isn’t made of words anymore.</p>
<p>As you say any word over and over again, your brain stops processing it as language, it loses all meaning, it just becomes sound.</p>
<p>And then there’s the self-awareness that keeps floating back in, that you’re saying this very silly self deprecating phrase, but you’ve gotta ignore that, it’s just sound, it’s just words, there’s no You to feel silly.</p>
<p>If you can meditate on this mantra until it loses all meaning, until its not funny anymore, you will have destroyed the line between holy man and actual goose.</p>
