<h2>Don't let the apocalypse get you down (it's only the end of the world again)</h2>
<p>Hoo boy, so. It’s the end-times, right? Capital-e Eschaton, yeah? <br/>
Well, that’s what they have been saying. All the omens are coming together, too. War in the fields of Harr-Megiddo, endless winter, fire, flood and plague, the whole lot.<br/>
Well, maybe it’s just Americans saying that, but so what? Our nation is gonna fall like Rome, any day now. Just like Rome, we grew too decadent and lazy, and just like Rome, we failed to support the infrastructure for our paradise. The federal government is gonna collapse like a Wal-Mart desk under a pity fuck.<br/>
No, wait, not until the Police State we’ve been perfecting finally has us all in line. It’s just like 1984. Didn’t you read 1984? Or maybe it was Brave New World. Either way those authors knew geopolitics and the machinery of totalitarian control. Boy howdy, we are in dark times.<br/>
Huh? What do you mean “What do we do to stop all this?”<br/>
There’s nothing to be done, go home. This was Written - it must be So.<br/>
Stop feeding that homeless person. Don’t waste your time going to law school - one public defender can’t save the blacks from racist judges, juries and cops. Reporters don’t make any money anymore. Get a real job. Save your time and money.<br/>
Why do you think you can change anything? Look at all the people who didn’t do anything. Look at all the people who never made waves. What makes you so special? <br/>
How do you know what you’re doing is helping? I mean, you’re probably just making it worse. Don’t embarrass yourself; have some dignity. Only fools fall in love. Did God tell you what to do? What good is your own reasoning?<br/>
What gives you the right? Why bother? </p>

<p><br/>
Because sometimes “Fuck it” should be followed by “Why not?”<br/>
- Saint Amir Zetathustra, heretic</p>
